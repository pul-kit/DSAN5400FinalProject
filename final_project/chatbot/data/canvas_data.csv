How can I use Canvas on my mobile device as an instructor?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-can-I-use-Canvas-on-my-mobile-device-as-an-instructor/ta-p/810,"Canvas is built on open web standards, so most features are supported on mobile devices. With the growing use of mobile devices, you should build your courses with best practices for mobile in mind.  You can access Canvas from any browser on your Android/iOS device. However, mobile browsers are not supported, and features may not function as expected compared to viewing Canvas in a fully supported desktop browser.  On mobile devices, Canvas is designed to be used within Canvas mobile applications. Canvas pages within a mobile browser are only supported when an action in the app links directly to the browser, such as when a student takes certain types of quizzes. Support is not extended to pages that cannot currently be used in the app, such as Conferences or Collaborations. Additionally, Canvas offers limited support for native mobile browsers on tablet devices. For details, please reference the limited-support mobile browser guidelines. We are actively improving our native mobile applications to support as many Canvas features as possible. Instructure has four native mobile applications for instructors free for download on both phones and tablets. You can learn more about mobile applications in the Canvas Mobile Guides."

A message is an individual message passed from one user to the other; in message threads, each message is individually counted. In group conversations, interactions are counted as long as the student is one of the recipients. Notifications are not included in analytics unless the user acts on the notification and generates a new message that passes through the Canvas Inbox. Announcements are not included in communication analytics.  You can also view specific communication data in the student interactions report. The Submissions graph shows the status of each submission for the student. The y-axis represents each assignment, while the x-axis represents the submission date. A green circle indicates an assignment that was submitted on time. A yellow triangle indicates an assignment that was submitted late. A red square indicates an assignment that is missing (not submitted). A white circle with a black outline indicates an assignment with a future due date.

The Grades graph shows the median, high, and low scores for each assignment. The x-axis represents each assignment, while the y-axis represents the number of points for an assignment. The vertical black line extends from the highest score to the lowest score [1]. The gray box extends from the 75th percentile to 25th percentile [2]. The horizontal black line shows the median score for the assignment [3]. The student's score is indicated by the same shapes found in the Submissions graph. A green circle indicates an assignment with a good score. A good score is equal to or greater than the median score. A yellow triangle indicates an assignment with a fair score. A fair score is below the median but still within the 75th to 25th percentile range. A red square indicates an assignment with a poor score. A poor score is below the 25th percentile. To view assignment names and details, hover your cursor over the graph [4]. To view analytics without hovering over graph columns, you can view all data in a table format. To switch to the table format, click the Analytics icon. The icon will switch from the left side to the right, indicating the current analytics view.

What is the difference between a Canvas Assignment and a Canvas Activity?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/What-is-the-difference-between-a-Canvas-Assignment-and-a-Canvas/ta-p/890,"Anything that appears in the Activity Stream is considered an activity. Some activities are graded (assignments) and others are not (events). Canvas makes a clear distinction between activities that students do for a grade (Canvas Assignments) and activities that students do to absorb new information, practice a new-found skill, or interact with a group to begin solving a problem (Canvas Activities). Students may be asked to engage in a number of Canvas Activities before they work on a Canvas Assignment, which will be evaluated by the instructor or their peers. When a Canvas Assignment is created, a new column is added to the gradebook (the ""Not Graded"" type being the only exception to this rule). Instructors and students will find that Canvas Assignments are automatically included on the Calendar, Assignments, and Syllabus pages. Also, Canvas Assignments can be evaluated with Rubrics and they can be aligned to course Outcomes. In contrast, when a new Canvas Activity is created, no new column is added to the gradebook. Students will find Activities linked on their respective pages (i.e. published Quizzes will show up on the Quizzes page), but they will NOT appear on the Assignments and Syllabus pages or the Calendar (the one exception being a Calendar event, which does show up on the Syllabus page and on the Calendar).  At this time, Canvas Activities CANNOT be evaluated with Rubrics or aligned to course Outcomes. Keep in mind the following when creating any kind of Canvas Assignment:   Additional options for Assignments and Graded Discussions:   Additional options for Assignments only: Here are two ways of accounting for extra credit:"
What assignment types can I create in a course?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/What-assignment-types-can-I-create-in-a-course/ta-p/627,"Canvas supports five assignment types: Assignments, Discussions, Quizzes, External Tools, and Not Graded. As an instructor, you can select an assignment type when creating an assignment shell. However, you can also create assignments within an assignment type by visiting each type's respective Index Page.  An Assignment is a Canvas assignment that can be submitted online through text entry, file uploads, media recordings, external tools, URLs, or Canvas pages. Assignments appear on the Assignments Index Page, the Gradebook (graded only), the Syllabus, and on the User Dashboard (graded only). Not Graded assignments may include a due date, however points or grades are not given for completing the assignment. Assignments can be assigned to individual students, groups, or sections. Throughout Canvas, users can recognize assignments with the Assignment icon. A Discussion is a Canvas assignment that will grade student response to discussion topics. This assignment will appear on the Assignment Index Page (graded only), the Discussions Index Page, the Gradebook (graded only), the Syllabus, and on the User Dashboard (graded only). Discussions can be assigned to individual students, groups, or sections. Throughout Canvas, users can recognize discussions with the Discussion icon. A Quiz is a Canvas assignment that can be used to conduct a survey or assess a student's comprehension of course content. This assignment will appear on the Assignments Index Page (graded only), the Quizzes Index Page, the Gradebook (graded only), the Syllabus, and on the User Dashboard (graded only). Quizzes can be assigned to individual students or sections; they cannot be assigned to groups. Throughout Canvas, users can recognize quizzes with the Quiz icon."
What is the difference between assignment due dates and availability dates?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/What-is-the-difference-between-assignment-due-dates-and/ta-p/897,"In addition to setting a due date for an assignment, instructors can specify a specific date range when students can submit the assignment. These dates are called availability dates. These dates are optional and can be set depending how you want to manage the assignment.  In Quizzes, availability dates may affect student submissions. For more details, view the Quiz availability dates lesson. Notes: The due date is the date and time when the assignment is due. Student assignments submitted after the due date will be marked as late in the Gradebook. Due Dates are not required in Canvas, but they are helpful in managing course workflow and deadlines. You can also set a specific time as part of the due date. When you change a due time on an assignment, the seconds value defaults to 0 unless the minutes value is set to 59, in which case, the seconds are also set to 59. For example, if you set a due date of September 19 at 4:15 pm, any student submission made at or after September 19 at 4:15:01 is marked late. If a date does not include a time, the listed date defaults to the course’s default due time. If you want to create a date range for students to view and submit an assignment, you can set availability dates. Availability dates can also be called lock dates. Available From [1]: the date and time when the Assignments will become available to students. If a due date does not include a time, the listed date defaults to the course's default due time. Students cannot view assignment content until after the Available from date has passed. Until [2]: the date and time when students can no longer submit the assignment. If no time is set, this time defaults to 11:59 pm for the course time zone and the assignment will close at 12:00:00 am of the following day. When the assignment is published, blank availability date fields allow the assignment to be submitted at any time throughout the entire course.  After you save the assignment, you can view the details for the assignment. If there is an assignment due date, the date displays under the Due heading [1]. If there are availability dates, they display under the Available from and Until headings [2]. You can also view details for all assignments on the Assignments Index Page. In Quizzes, the Until date does not restrict student access to view the result of their quiz. For instance, you may not want students to view the results of their quiz after the Until date. To make this change, you need to edit the quiz options and restrict the quiz results. Due Dates and Availability Dates can be used together, depending on how you want to manage the assignment. Here are some common scenarios you can create with dates. All examples include a Due Date, though they are not required for assignments.   If you want to keep an assignment open throughout the entire course, do not set any availability dates. When no availability dates are set, the assignment can be submitted by all users until the course ends. For example, if you want students to be able to view and submit the assignment at any time but reward those who submit by a due date of September 19 at 11:59 pm, only set the Due Date. Canvas views and scores the assignment as follows: Note: Due times set to 12am and 24:00 autocorrect to 11:59pm and 23:59. If you want to keep students from viewing and submitting an assignment until a specific date, set an Available From date. Assignment content is not visible to students until after the Available from date and time passes. However, rubrics are visible to students regardless of availability dates. For example, if you set an assignment as due on September 19 at 11:59 pm, but you do not want students to submit the assignment until September 9 at 12 am, set the Available From date as September 9 at 12 am.  Canvas views and scores the assignment as follows: If you want to allow students to submit an assignment until a specific date, set an Until date. The date you set depends on whether you want to accept late submissions. When the Until date has passed, students can still view or download their submissions and view any submission comments. No late submissions—Some instructors do not allow any late submissions by setting the Until Date as the Due Date. For example, If you want to allow students to view the assignment at any time with a due date of September 19 at 11:59 pm, but you do not want to accept any late submissions, also set the Until Date as September 19 at 11:59 pm.   Canvas views and scores the assignment as follows:  Note: Due times set to 12am and 24:00 autocorrect to 11:59pm and 23:59. Allow late submissions—Some instructors allow late submissions within a specific period of time after the due date. For example, if you want to allow students to submit a late assignment up to three days after the due date, set the Until Date as September 22 at 11:59 pm.  Canvas views and scores the assignment as follows: Note: In Quizzes, the autosubmit feature is tied to the Until date, which may affect student submissions. For more details, view the Quiz availability dates lesson. If you want to allow students to submit an assignment only in a specific date range, set both availability dates for the assignment. For example, if an assignment is due September 19 at 11:59 pm, but you only want students to be able to submit the assignment between September 9 and September 22, and you want to allow late assignments for 3 days, set the Available From date as September 9 at 12 am, and the Until date as September 22 at 11:59 pm. Canvas views and scores the assignment as follows: You may be able to update due dates and availability dates for multiple assignments at one time. If no time is set, the due time defaults to 11:59:59 pm for the course time zone, and the assignment is marked late at 12:00:00 am. For example, if you set a due date of September 19 at 11:59 pm, the assignment is marked late if submitted at or after September 20 at 12:00:00. "

How do I weight the final course grade based on assignment groups?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-weight-the-final-course-grade-based-on-assignment/ta-p/746,"You can weight final grades based on assignment groups. Selecting this option assigns a weight to each assignment group, not the assignments themselves. Within each assignment group, a percentage is calculated by dividing the total points a student has earned by the total points possible for all assignments in that group.  For example, if an assignment group included three assignments totaling 25 points, and a student's scores totaled 15 points, the student would earn 60% for the assignment group (15/25). This percentage is then multiplied by the selected group weight. Each assignment group calculation is added together to create the final grade. For example, an instructor may create three assignment groups (A, B, and C) weighted at 20%, 50%, and 30%, respectively. The total score equation for a course with three assignment groups would be (percentage A x weight A) + (percentage B x weight B) + (percentage C x weight C) = final course percentage. If a student scores 75% in Group A, 98% in Group B, and 87% in Group C, the final score would be calculated as (.75 x .20) + (.98 x .50) + (.87 x .30) = .901, or 90.1%.  The final score calculation is changed if there are no graded items in an assignment group. In this case, all assignment groups with graded items will be divided by their combined weight, and the assignment groups without graded items are removed from the equation. If the previous example were adjusted so Group C contained no graded discussions, assignments, or quizzes, the calculation for final score would be [(.75 x .20) + (.98 x .50)] ÷ .70 = .9143, or 91.43%. Multiple Grading Periods If your course includes Multiple Grading Periods, you cannot change assignment group weights once an assignment group has assignments in a closed grading period. Additionally, weighted grading periods can also support weighted assignment groups in a course. The weight of an assignment group is applied to the grading period’s final grade, and each grading period’s final grade is added together to calculate the overall grade.  If you choose to use weighted assignment groups, separate assignment groups should be created for each grading period in the course. If an assignment group contains assignments that fall into multiple grading periods with different weighted percentages, grades may have unintended consequences. Note: If an assignment group is weighted to zero percent, any course items added to the group will not count toward the final grade.  In Course Navigation, click the Assignments link. Click the Assignments Options icon [1] and select the Assignment Groups Weights option [2]. Click the Weight final grade based on assignment groups checkbox.  Enter the percentage weights for each of the different Assignment Groups you created [1]. The percentage weights you specify here will determine how Canvas calculates the final grade for your course. These percentages can be changed at any time and students will be notified when any changes are made. The weights will show up in the Gradebook for both students and instructors.

How do I create rules for an assignment group? ,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-create-rules-for-an-assignment-group/ta-p/848,"Once you have added assignments to your assignment group, you can create rules for the entire assignment group. Assignment group rules determine how Canvas handles any exceptions you want to create for grade calculations. Assignment groups can be weighted or unweighted. When using the lowest or highest score rule, an assignment group must include at least one score, plus the number of dropped scores and the number of assignments that should not be dropped. For instance, if you have a rule for dropping three scores and one Never Drop assignment, you would need five student scores in the assignment group to have all three lowest or highest scores dropped.  Canvas considers how the rule most negatively or positively affects the student's overall score. A rule to drop the lowest score will remove the assignment score(s) from a student's group percentage calculation that will result in the best possible score for that group. A rule to drop the highest score will remove the assignment score(s) from a student's group percentage calculation that will result in the lowest possible score for that group. Dropping both the lowest and the highest score(s) removes any outlying scores and calculates a student’s grade based upon the remaining middle scores.  Dropping scores is based on the impact to the total points for that assignment group. In some cases, the point value may be considered more important than percentage score when determining which assignment to drop. For example, if a student earns 100% on a 50-point assignment, 65% on a 100-point assignment, and 50% on a 24-point assignment, the student’s total score is 127 out of 174 points, or 73% for the assignment group. If an instructor sets a rule to drop the assignment with the lowest score in the assignment group, Canvas will drop the score that gives the student a better total score for the group. Even though the 50% score is the lowest percentage, the assignment with the 65% score will be dropped, giving the student a score of 62 out of 74 points, or an 84%, for the assignment group.  Multiple Grading Periods If your course includes Multiple Grading Periods, you cannot change assignment group rules once an assignment group has assignments in a closed grading period.  Additionally, if an assignment group contains assignments that fall into multiple grading periods, grades may have unintended consequences when calculating assignment group rules. In Course Navigation, click the Assignments link. Click the Assignment Group Options drop-down menu [1]. Click the Edit link [2].

You can use the arrows to adjust the number.  To drop a certain number of highest scores, enter the number in the Highest Scores field. You can use the arrows to adjust the number.  To tell Canvas to never drop a certain assignment, click the Add an assignment link. In the Assignment drop-down menu [1], select the name of the assignment in the Assignment Group that should never be dropped. To select another assignment, click the Add another assignment link [2]. When you are finished adding rules, click the Save button. In the Assignment Group toolbar, Canvas will show the number of rules assigned to the group [1].

How do I create an online assignment?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-create-an-online-assignment/ta-p/950,"You can create online assignments for students to submit their assignments through Canvas. Students can submit audio or video recordings by recording new media or uploading existing media. Files submitted to an online assignment do not count against the user's storage quota. When allowing file uploads as an online entry option, you can restrict certain types of files for assignment submissions. In the case of restricting assignments with an odd or unusual file type, try adding it to your course to confirm the file is accepted before requesting students to submit the file type. Compound file types are not supported. If your institution has enabled Google Docs, the Google Apps LTI, or the Microsoft Office 365 LTI, students can upload files from their respective Google Drive or OneDrive account directly. (If only Google Docs are enabled for your institution, students must connect to Google Drive as a web service to submit an assignment as a Google Doc, Google Sheet, or Google Slide.) You can allow Google Drive and OneDrive files as submission types by selecting the File Uploads checkbox when creating an assignment. Google Drive File Types Students can submit Google Doc (.gdoc), Google Sheet (.gsheet), or Google Slide (.gslide) files. They can also use Google Docs to submit uploaded Word (.doc/.docx), Excel (.xls/.xlsx), PowerPoint (.ppt/.pptx), and PDF files not converted to Google Docs formatting. When Google file types are submitted as an assignment submission, those files will convert to their Microsoft counterpart file types and appear in the submission as respective Word, Excel, or PowerPoint files. Canvas uses the conversion file type for submissions (and to render supported file types as DocViewer files in SpeedGrader), so if you want to restrict file types to only include Google file types, you must also include the file types for each respective Microsoft file type as well. For instance, if you want to only allow Google Slide submissions, you must include .pptx as a restrictive file type, otherwise Canvas will not show the .gslide files in the Google Doc tab.

How do I add a moderated assignment to be graded by multiple reviewers?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-add-a-moderated-assignment-to-be-graded-by-multiple/ta-p/605,"When creating an assignment, you can choose to set up an assignment with moderated grading. Moderated grading allows multiple reviewers to grade a students work and create draft or provisional grades for an assignment. For instance, you may want to allow two TAs in your course to grade all assignments, and you can review their assessments before determining the final grade. This feature can also be used to create a sampling of students for assignment review to ensure grading is consistent and allows secondary grade reviews.  When you add a rubric to a moderated assignment, any associated outcome results display in the Learning Mastery Gradebook only after final grades are posted.  In moderated grading, anyone with assignment creation permissions can specify an assignment submission to be reviewed by one or multiple graders, edit the assignment if necessary, review the grades, and select which grade should be set as the final grade for each student. For each moderated submission, the user set as the moderator is the only user who can specify the final grade for each assignment. Any grader can be specified as the grader who can determine the final grade as long as they have the corresponding permission, but the moderator does not have to personally grade the assignment. Once the assignment is created, only the moderator and admins will be able to change the assigned final grader.  Moderated Grading For moderated assignments, when an assignment reaches its maximum number of graders, the grading notification will be removed from the Dashboard for graders who have not yet assessed the assignment. However, submissions can still be accessed through the Gradebook, if needed. SpeedGrader displays submissions in a read-only mode to hide all student names and submission details.  Anonymous Grading Moderated grading can be enabled with anonymous grading assignment options. If enabled in an assignment, anonymous grading is enabled by default in SpeedGrader, although anonymous grading in SpeedGrader can be enabled separately if not enabled for an assignment. Notes: In Course Navigation, click the Assignments link. To create an assignment with all assignment details at the same time, click the Add Assignment button. If you want to edit an existing assignment that has not yet received student submissions, click the name of the assignment. Add details to the assignment. Click the Moderated Grading checkbox.

If the number of graders is changed to a higher number, the page displays a message that there are not enough course users with grading permissions to fulfill the desired number of graders [2].  If you want to allow graders to view each other's comments, select the Graders can view each other's comments checkbox. This option is selected by default. Note: If anonymous grading is also enabled for your course, selecting this option displays the Graders cannot view each other's names checkbox in the anonymous grading assignment options.  This option allows graders to view comments from other graders but not view the name associated with each comment.

How do I give extra credit in a course?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-give-extra-credit-in-a-course/ta-p/1253,"Extra credit is currently not a default option in Canvas. However, you can give students extra credit using a variety of options.  Notes:  Create a new assignment with zero points possible [1] and select any submission type [2]. Assignments set to the No Submission type work well for classroom activities, such as in-class discussions or presentations. After students complete an online submission or complete and submit work offline, you can add and adjust points in the Gradebook. Note: For a zero-point assignment to factor into a student's grade, you must add a positive point value to at least one additional assignment in any assignment group. Add extra points to an Assignment you've already created. Manually enter the extra points in the Gradebook. For example, this assignment is worth 40 points. Adding 5 extra points will bring the assignment total for this student to 45 points. The added points will increase total points calculated in the Gradebook's final grade.  You can use Fudge points within SpeedGrader to add points to a quiz. Fudge points allow you to manually adjust an overall quiz score. Add an additional Criterion to a Rubric for extra credit. Make sure you make the rubric worth more than the assignment and you can give students extra points or not without affecting the actual assignment points.  You can add extra credit using a rubric in SpeedGrader. Enter a point value that is greater than the points possible for a criterion [1]. The Total Points calculation will reflect any extra points awarded for each Criterion [2]. Note: For SpeedGrader to automatically update the rubric point value for grading, select the Use this rubric for assignment grading checkbox when adding the Rubric to an assignment. Otherwise, you can update the grade field manually. You can manually add extra points by editing the grade shown in the Grade field in SpeedGrader. Assignments must be housed within an assignment group. Assignment groups can be unweighted or weighted, depending on how you wish to grade students within your course. Learn more about giving extra credit using assignment groups. Notes:  When assignment groups are not weighted, you can create extra credit assignments in their own assignment group if you wish. You may want to create a separate group to help distinguish between the different types of assignments. In this example, this entire assignment group has no points possible [1].  When the student completes the work required for the extra credit assignments, you can manually add points to the Gradebook. When assignment groups are weighted, Canvas will not calculate grades for an entire group that has no points possible. Therefore, for extra credit assignments to calculate correctly in weighted groups, they must be housed within an existing assignment group that has at least one assignment worth more than zero points.  In this example, the extra credit assignment is housed within the Extra Credit assignment group with multiple assignments worth more than zero points [1]. Notice that the assignment groups weights total 110% [2]. Any assignment placed within the Extra Credit assignment group will have either a positive or neutral effect on your students' overall grade. Additionally, if a student does not submit the extra credit assignment, their grade will not be negatively impacted.  When the student completes the work required for the extra credit assignments, you can manually add points to the Gradebook. If you create your extra credit assignments with zero points within their own assignment group, but you decide to weigh your assignment groups, your extra credit assignments will not calculate correctly within Canvas. Canvas cannot calculate assignment groups where there are no points possible. For example, if the student has 12 points of 0 points possible, Canvas can't determine the impact to the overall grade because 12 cannot be divided by 0. An error will appear in the total grade column. In this example, the two extra credit assignments (both with zero possible points) have been placed in an assignment group called Extra Credit. However, the assignment group has been weighted. The warning notification indicates that the score does not include Extra Credit (as an assignment group) because the entire group has no points possible. In this situation, the assignments will have to be moved to another assignment group, or you will need to include an assignment within the Extra Credit assignment group that has at least one point possible."

However, you must first specify which assignment(s) in the course should be sent to your SIS as part of the grade publishing process. Each assignment must be modified individually. However, your institution may have already enabled an option for all assignments to be configured for your SIS.  Once a graded assignment is set up to be sent to your SIS, you can manage the sync to SIS option using the Sync to SIS icon on the Assignment and Quizzes pages. Some assignment types are not supported for grade passback, including Not Graded assignment types and differentiated assignments like those assigned by MasteryPaths.

How do I use the Roll Call Attendance tool in a course?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-the-Roll-Call-Attendance-tool-in-a-course/ta-p/1003,"After the Attendance tool has been enabled for your course, you can configure the attendance tool to meet the needs of your students. However, some items cannot be configured until after your course is published and students have accepted the course invitation.  Note: The Attendance tool must be enabled by your Canvas admin before it can be used in your course. If you cannot see the Attendance link in Course Navigation, please contact your administrator. In Course Navigation, click the Attendance link. Note: The Attendance link does not display to students, so you do not need to hide this link in the Navigation tab within Course Settings.   To edit Roll Call settings, click the Settings icon [1], then click the Roll Call Settings button [2]. You can exclude the Roll Call assignment from the final grade and adjust the lateness value. If you do not want the Roll Call Attendance assignment to count toward the final grade, select the Do not count attendance toward final grade checkbox. Note: Excluding an assignment from the final grade can also be managed from the assignment settings. However, it is recommended to manage the setting in Roll Call settings.  To specify a lateness percentage, move the slider bar. By default, the lateness bar is set to 80%. The lateness percentage indicates the attendance score a student will receive if they are marked late. For example, a student with one presence (100%) and one lateness (80%) will have an average attendance score of 90%. When your course is published and students have accepted course invitations, you can create a seating chart in the Class view. When your course is published and students have accepted course invitations, you can use a student to manage badges in your course. Any badges added at the account level will automatically display as badges in your course. You can add additional badges for your course before you begin taking roll call.  If you want to change the value of Attendance in your course, or if you want to remove Attendance from the Gradebook completely, currently you must take roll call for at least one student before you can make any changes in Roll Call. Learn more about how to change the value of Roll Call Attendance."
How do I edit the Roll Call Attendance assignment?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-edit-the-Roll-Call-Attendance-assignment/ta-p/569,"After the first time you take roll call, Canvas automatically creates an assignment for Roll Call Attendance and adds a column to the Gradebook. By default, attendance is worth 100 points. To avoid Attendance calculation errors, you should not delete, rename, or unpublish the Attendance assignment. If the Attendance assignment is deleted, the Roll Call tool will not be able to take attendance. Canvas will automatically create a new Attendance assignment within 15 minutes after a failed attendance attempt due to a deleted Attendance assignment. Instructors can edit several components of the Roll Call Attendance assignment:  Notes:  If you are using weighted assignment groups and would rather set grade weighting for attendance, you can create a new weighted assignment group for Attendance. You can drag and drop the Roll Call Attendance assignment by clicking and grabbing the handle icon.  Note: You can also move the assignment by editing the assignment, locating the Assignment Group menu, selecting the name of the assignment group, and saving the assignment. In Assignment Settings, click the weight final grade checkbox [1]. Set the group percentage value to your preferred percentage value (zero up to 100) [2], then click the Save button [3].  Make sure the Attendance assignment is moved into the Roll Call assignment group.  The percentage value you set for the group will control the point value assigned to the Attendance assignment, despite the assigned point value. Note: If you want to set the percentage value as zero, the point value for the assignment must be higher than zero. Canvas cannot calculate weighted assignment groups with zero points possible. If you are not using weighted assignment groups and just want to edit the points assigned for Attendance, you can edit the point value in the assignment. However, this adjustment is only recommended if (1) you are never going to change the point value again and (2) you make the adjustment after your first roll call entry.  To change the point value for the assignment, edit the assignment, then in the points field [1], enter the new point value for attendance. At the bottom of the window, click the Save button [2]. Note: The Attendance assignment will not appear until you have taken roll for at least one student.  The Gradebook doesn't currently adjust point value changes accurately after point values have been changed, and the percentage values in the SpeedGrader and the Gradebook will be incorrect.  Return to roll call, click the Unmark All button, and then take attendance for all students as normal. The percentage value will then adjust correctly in both SpeedGrader and the Gradebook. If you make this change immediately after the first time you take roll in your course and edit the point value, you only have to adjust your work once. If you do not want Attendance to appear in the Gradebook as a graded assignment, you can edit the Attendance assignment and change the assignment type. Students can still view the assignment but it will not appear in their grades. To remove the assignment from the Gradebook, edit the attendance assignment, then in the Display Grade as menu [1], select the Not Graded option. At the bottom of the window, click the Save button [2]. Note: Once you have changed the assignment type, you cannot change it back to a graded assignment. Please ensure you do not want to grade Attendance before changing the assignment type.   If you do not want the Roll Call Attendance assignment to be calculated in the final grade, you can choose to exclude the assignment from final grade calculations. You can manage this setting in attendance assignment settings and in Roll Call settings. However, it's recommended to manage this setting in Roll Call Settings. "

How do I import Thin Common Cartridge files as separate modules?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-import-Thin-Common-Cartridge-files-as-separate-modules/ta-p/1004,"If your institution uses Thin Common Cartridge files, you can use the select specific content option in course imports to import content as separate modules. Thin Common Cartridge is a subset of the full Common Cartridge specification. Selecting content in a Thin Common Cartridge file is structured differently than other import types. Thin Common Cartridge is a lightweight metadata structure most commonly used by K12 institutions that allows publishers to provide digital resources using LTI links (external tools), which usually contains a significant number of resources in one common cartridge interchange file (.imscc). Thin Common Cartridge files are designed by creating items grouped into a folder or series of folders that defines how the content should be organized for the learner.  When importing Thin Common Cartridge files, Canvas uses metadata identifiers and titles to simulate the hierarchical structure within the Thin Common Cartridge file. This structure appears as nested content within the Modules content heading, allowing users to view a structured organization and locate the content they want to import into the course. By default, grouped content is imported as one module, but they can also be imported as separate modules. Individual content within a content group is automatically imported as separate modules.  In Course Navigation, click the Settings link. Click the Import Course Content link. In the Content Type drop-down menu, select the Common Cartridge 1.x Package option. Complete any additional fields required for the content.  In the Content section, click the Select specific content radio button.  When importing content, a message displays explaining that importing the same course content or export package more than once overwrites any existing content in the course. Click the Import button [1].  A progress indicator displays the upload status by percentage [2]. In the Current Jobs section, click the Select Content button. Thin Common Cartridge files are shown as one module. Click the Modules expand icon. Locate the content by expanding the nested structure. Content groups show the number of items within the group [1].  If you want to import an entire content group, select the checkbox next to the group [2]. Like other course import types, selecting a content group selects all items within the module group. However, Thin Common Cartridge content is always imported as one module, which can be extremely cumbersome in a Canvas course.  By default, content is imported as one module [1]. If you would rather import content as separate modules, click the Import sub-modules separately radio button [2].  Note: If you want to import several content groups as separate modules, module settings are applied on a per-content-group basis, meaning you must fully expand each content group and specify the separate modules option. Otherwise, all selected content in the hierarchy will always be imported as one module. To import only a few items from a content group, select the specific items to be imported [1]. Canvas places a dash in the content group checkbox [2], indicating not all items are selected within the group.  Selecting individual content items automatically imports content as separate modules.

How do I create a new course from the Dashboard as an instructor?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-create-a-new-course-from-the-Dashboard-as-an-instructor/ta-p/794,"If you are allowed to add new courses in Canvas, you can create a new course from your Canvas Dashboard. New courses are created as course shells which can host course content and enrollments for your institution. If enabled by your institution, you may be able to select a sub-account for your new course. If this feature is not enabled, your new course will be added to your institution's Manually-Created Courses sub-account. When you create a course from the Dashboard, you are automatically added to the course as an instructor. No other enrollments exist in the course, though you may be able to add users to a new course. Additionally, new courses do not contain course content. In the new course, you can create new content and add existing content using the course import tool and by sharing content from an existing course. Alternatively, you can create a new course to use as a sandbox. A sandbox is a course without student enrollments where you can create, modify, and preview course content and structure  without student interference. You can then share or import your sandbox content into live courses.  Notes:  In the Global Navigation Menu, click the Dashboard link. In the Dashboard sidebar, click the Start a New Course button. You may need to scroll down to see this button. Note: If you do not see this button in Canvas, your institution has disabled this feature.

How do I change the start and end dates for a course section as an instructor?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-change-the-start-and-end-dates-for-a-course-section-as/ta-p/1265,"By default, sections inherit course dates set for your entire institution. If a course does not include specific dates, the section dates default to term dates. However, as an instructor, you may need to change the start and end dates for a course section. Dates can be shorter than or overlap the course or term dates. Adding section dates may also affect the Courses page and the placement of the section's course in the Past, Current, or Future Enrollments list for students. For more information, view the interactive Student Course Visibility and Participation flowchart.  Limit User Participation Dates You can set whether or not students can only participate in the section during the specified section dates using the Student Participation checkbox. Participation means that students can submit assignments, post discussions, upload files, or take part in any other action-based task for the course section. If you limit students to only be able to participate during the section dates, they can accept the course section invitation, access the course section, and look at content, but they cannot fully participate until the first day of the course for the section. When the course section is concluded, the course section is placed in a read-only state. Section Override Dates Section override dates are only created if the Student Participation checkbox is selected as part of creating section start and end dates (both dates are required). Students can participate in the course section before and after the start and end date, and participation will always be determined by the course dates. If a course does not include course dates, dates are determined by term dates. Dashboard Considerations The Student Participation sections checkbox may also affect courses that have been marked as a favorite and display in the Dashboard. If a section includes an override date and the Student Participation checkbox is selected, students cannot participate in the course after the section end date, and the course will be removed from the Dashboard.  Moreover, if the Student Participation checkbox is not selected, the course will still display in the Dashboard as a favorite course after the section end date since the course section still allows participation as an active course. The course will not be removed until the course section is concluded via course/term dates. However, if the Student Participation checkbox is not selected for the section, the section dates determine the placement of the course section in the Past, Current, or Future Enrollments list regardless of the course/term dates. Note: You can only change section end dates when your enrollment is active. Section dates cannot be changed once your enrollment has concluded for the course. In Course Navigation, click the Settings link. Click the Sections tab. Click the name of the section. Click the Edit Section button. Click the Starts calendar icon [1]. Select a new start date for the section [2]. Click the Ends calendar icon [1]. Select a new end date for the section [2]. Note: End dates occur at precisely the minute they are set. For example, a section with an end time at 11:59pm will end at 11:59:00. If you do not want to let students participate in the course section outside of the section dates, select the Students can only participate in the course between these dates checkbox [1]. Selecting this checkbox creates a section override and overrides the course dates. Students can only participate in the course section between the section dates, and the course section will be in a read-only state outside the course section dates. This checkbox only affects student and observer roles; all other roles default to term access dates.  Notes:  Click the Update Section button."

This feature is helpful for instructors who teach several sections of the same course and only want to manage course data in one location. Instructors can allow students to view users in other sections or limit them to only view users in the same section. Section names do not change when they are cross-listed; the section is just moved to another course. Cross-listing should be done while courses are unpublished. Coursework is retained with the course, not with the section enrollments, so if a published course is cross-listed, all cross-listed enrollments will lose any associated assignment submissions and grades. To cross-list a course, you must know the name of the course or the course ID into which you are cross-listing. However, using a course ID is a better way to confirm you are cross-listing a section into the correct course. You can find the course ID by opening the course and viewing the number at the end of the browser URL (e.g. account.instructure.com/courses/XXXXXX). Sections can only be in one course at a time. Once a section is cross-listed, you can re-cross-list the section into another course if necessary.

What are the different states of a Canvas course?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/What-are-the-different-states-of-a-Canvas-course/ta-p/1184,"Canvas courses have three essential states: unpublished, published, and concluded. Unpublished courses are courses in preparation; they are courses being authored by instructors, instructional designers, and administrators. While a course is unpublished, students cannot access or participate in the course. When the course material is deemed ready by the designer, instructor, or administrator, it may be published. These courses appear in the Future Enrollments section of the Courses menu. Unless you or your Canvas admin restrict permission to view future courses,  and students can access their future enrollments in their Courses list before the course start date. If a course is never published, the course will remain in the students' Future Enrollments section.  Published courses are instantly available to students who may be assigned via SIS integration, or manually by the instructor, administrator, or TA. When published, activity is dictated by the dates and status of course assignments and modules. Individual assignments, modules, or other course content can be individually locked (made unavailable to students) or assigned a date in the future, prior to which students will not be able to see or participate in said course component. If courses are set within term dates, these courses appear in the My Courses section of the Courses menu. However, if courses have course participation dates and have different start dates, the courses appear in the Future Enrollments section until the course participation start date. Concluded courses are courses that are completed according to the SIS information or term dates, or courses that have been manually marked complete by an instructor or administrator. In a concluded course, instructors and students can access course content but can no longer participate in the course and the course is archived in a read-only state. Students may be restricted from viewing concluded courses. You also may be able to manually conclude an individual course enrollment.  Unless you or your Canvas admin restrict permission to view prior courses, these courses appear in the Past Courses section of the Courses menu. "

Locked Objects You cannot manage any objects that are locked in your course. Locked objects enforce the attributes defined by your Canvas admin, which can include content, point values, due dates, and availability dates. You can view locked attributes by viewing an individual locked object.  Attributes for locked objects may be changed from the blueprint course at any time. Any change to an attribute retroactively applies to all locked objects in your course. If an attribute is changed in the blueprint course, any locked attributes in your course that vary from locked attributes in the blueprint course will trigger unsynced changes in the blueprint course and override your course.

Content Sync After a change is made to an object or attribute, the blueprint course sidebar displays a sync option indicating that unsynced changes have been made in the course. Content can be synced at any time. All course content will be included in a blueprint sync, regardless of whether content is locked. Changed content will always overwrite the existing content in the associated courses for all locked objects. Content that can be managed by an instructor or new content created in an associated course by the instructor is not affected. Notifications within associated courses can only be sent if the notification trigger has not yet occurred. Features such as announcements in a blueprint course may need to be created as a delayed post so the announcement displays in the associated course after syncing course content. Content State The sync will include the state of each object as it exists in the blueprint course. For instance, if an assignment is unpublished in the blueprint course, it will also be unpublished in the associated course. However, once the state is changed in the associated course, the state within the blueprint course will no longer apply. Modules Exceptions If a blueprint course includes Modules, changes to the modules structure are triggered as part of a course sync. Modules cannot be locked, but course state applies to all individual module items.

The only exception is Course Settings, which must be selected on a per-sync basis as part of the sync options [2]. You can also create a notification about the sync from the sidebar [3]. If you know what content is being synced and you are ready to sync your content, you can sync updates directly from the sidebar [4]. If you are not sure what content is being synced, or if you just want to confirm existing changes in the course, you can view specific details about the unsynced changes by clicking the Unsynced Changes link. The Unsynced Changes page shows the specific content that has been updated. Each content object shows the current status of the object (locked or unlocked) [1], the name of the content item [2], the content change [3], and the content object type [4].  Content changes can be created, updated, or deleted. Updated changes indicate any change to existing content. Course Settings include all settings options in the course, including Course Navigation. To sync Course Settings to associated courses, select the Include Course Settings checkbox [1].  If you want to send a notification about the blueprint sync, click the Send Notification checkbox [2].

How do I use grading periods in a course?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-grading-periods-in-a-course/ta-p/1030,"If your course includes Multiple Grading Periods, grading periods created at the account level automatically display in your course and can be filtered in the Assignments Index Page, the Gradebook, and the student Grades page.  Grading periods consist of a specific date range that define the grading period. Grading periods also include a close date as to when you can no longer edit grades in a grading period. Grading periods can also be weighted. To view grading period date ranges and any weighted grading periods, you can view grading periods in a course. At the course level, Canvas validates all assignments against closed grading periods in Canvas. For a complete overview of the Multiple Grading Periods feature and current limitations associated with close dates, please view the Close Dates for Grading Periods document in the Canvas Community. When you create an assignment, by default each assignment is assigned to everyone. However, the assignment can be differentiated among course sections, course groups, or individual students.  When grading periods are enabled, the due date of the assignment determines the grading period where the assignment appears in the Gradebook. If no due date is set, the assignment defaults to the last grading period available for the course. When grading periods are weighted, assignments outside of grading periods do not count toward the final grade. Note: The Assign field cannot be edited for anyone if the due date is in a closed grading period. However, you can add additional differentiated assignments with due dates outside the closed grading period. Assignments with due dates in open grading periods cannot be edited from an open grading period to a date in a closed grading period, but the due date can be edited to any date within an open grading period. These restrictions do not apply to availability dates, which can be set to overlap a grading period. To view the Grading Period filter, click the Apply Filters button [1]. Then in the Filters section, click the Grading Periods option [2]. The Grading Period filter lists grading periods for the course in a drop-down menu [3]. By default, the Gradebook displays the current grading period. However, you can view and filter grades by previous or future grading period.  Assignments are grouped in the grading period according to the published assignment due date (unpublished assignments never appear in the Gradebook). If there is no due date for the published assignment, the assignment defaults to the latest grading period. Grading periods cannot be selected within an individual assignment.  You can only edit grades for assignments in a current or future grading period. Once the close date for a grading period has passed, you cannot edit grades for the prior grading period. Assignments cannot overlap grading periods except with differentiated assignments. When differentiated assignment dates overlap grading periods, the assignment appears in each appropriate grading period.  When using the Multiple Grading Periods feature, you may be able to view total grades in the All Grading Periods view. This grades view also includes displaying assignment group totals. Viewing total grades in a course is managed by your Canvas administrator. By default, viewing total grades in the All Grading Periods view is disabled in a course and affects the global Grades view, courses Grades view, and the instructor Gradebook. Students have one of two options from the global Grades page. When viewing total grades is disabled [1], students do not have the option to view All Grading Periods. They can only view the grade for a specific grading period in the course.  When viewing total grades is enabled [2], students can select the All Grading Periods option and can view the appropriate grade. In the course Grades page, a student's view of their total grade may be limited. When viewing total grades is disabled, students cannot view the total grade calculation in either the sidebar or the bottom of the grades page. Calculations also include assignment totals for weighted assignment groups. Hiding total grades impacts calculations for student What-If Grades. When viewing total grades is enabled, students can still view the total grade for All Grading Periods and any assignment group calculations. When viewing total grades is disabled, students can still view total grades for an individual grading period unless you hide student totals in Course Settings. When this setting is enabled, students will not be able to view any totals in their global grades page or course grades page. At the course level, Canvas validates all assignments against closed grading periods in Canvas. You cannot edit assignments in closed grading periods. If an assignment is in a closed grading period, the assignment shows that the submission is in a closed grading period. Learn how to view the date range of a course grading period.

How do I create assignment columns for non-submission assignments in the Gradebook?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-create-assignment-columns-for-non-submission/ta-p/680,"Columns in the Gradebook are only created by adding an assignment in Canvas. If you need to create a column in the Gradebook to use for manual grading, you can create a No Submission or On Paper assignment.  No Submission assignments are when you do not want students to submit an assignment in Canvas. This assignment type can be used to create extra columns in the Gradebook, create an assignment that involves multiple scores, or give extra credit. On Paper assignments are when you want students to submit an assignment to you but not through Canvas. This assignment type applies to traditional face-to-face courses or hybrid courses when you want the assignment turned in during class, but you still want to create a column in the Canvas Gradebook for grading purposes. When students view the assignment, they see that the assignment will be submitted on paper. To create multiple columns at once, you can upload changes to the Gradebook.

How do I use the icons and colors in the Gradebook?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-the-icons-and-colors-in-the-Gradebook/ta-p/781,"The Gradebook includes several icons and colors that may display in the assignment columns, assignment groups, and Total column.  Icons and colors are simply gradebook indicators to assist you with course grading. All published assignments count toward a student's total grade unless they are excused assignments.  The Gradebook displays one Assignment Icon [1], regardless of assignment type, to note a submission that needs to be graded. A submission is noted as needing to be graded in the following conditions: An assignment with grades hidden from students is indicated by the Visibility icon [2]. Additional situations apply: Note: The Assignment icon does not display for resubmitted discussions. Each grading type shows up differently in the Gradebook. Here you can see how each grading type is represented: The Black Warning Icon [1] notifies you that the final score does not include one of the assignment groups because the group has zero points possible (the warning will tell you which assignment group is affected). This icon only displays in the total column related to assignment group errors.  You can correct the assignment group warnings by making sure a weighted assignment group has an assignment worth more than zero points, or, if an assignment is supposed to have zero points, adding another assignment with more than zero points to the assignment group. The Red Warning Icon [2] notifies you that the entered grade is not supported in the grading scheme. Canvas will also display an invalid grade warning message when an invalid grade is entered. The Grade Detail Tray Warning Icon displays a warning icon for assignments that are not calculated as part of the final grade. This icon displays if the Do not count this assignment towards the final grade option is selected, or if the assignment is in a weighted assignment group with no weighted percentage. The Grade Detail Tray also reflects if assignment grades are hidden. If you have applied a manual posting policy in a course or in an individual assignment, the Manual label will display in the Gradebook.  The Manual label [1] indicates that a manual posting policy is currently in place and future grades are hidden from student view or that a manual posting policy was previously used to hide grades in an assignment. If you have selected a manual posting policy for a course, all assignments that have hidden grades will display the Visibility icon. The Visibility icon [2] indicates that there are grades within the assignment that must be posted before they can be viewed by students. When grades are hidden from student view, the Total column also displays the Visibility icon [3] to indicate that the total grade in the Gradebook differs from the total grade viewed by the student. The Gradebook includes a default set of colors that indicate various statuses for assignments: Status colors in your Gradebook may vary, as you can change the status colors for each status in the Gradebook. However, you cannot change the status names. Gradebook rows alternate white and gray shading, so some colors may seem darker if they display in a row with gray shading. Notes:  When using differentiated assignments, the assignment appears as a column for all students, but grade cells are grayed out for students who are not part of the assignment and do not include a dash. Grades cannot be assigned to students who are not part of the assignment; those assignments are not factored into overall grades. In the student grades page, students can only view assignments that have been assigned to them. Differentiated assignments are also used in MasteryPaths. If your course uses multiple grading periods, submission cells for an entire assignment in a closed grading period are grayed out in the Gradebook. Assignments in a closed grading period cannot be edited. Some columns are completely disabled until the status of the assignment is changed. Disabled columns do not include dashes in the Gradebook cells, which indicates that grades cannot be entered, and display a gray background.  Disabled columns are labeled for unpublished assignments [1] and anonymous assignments [2]. Grades cannot be entered for unpublished assignments until the assignment is published. For anonymous assignments, grade cells do not display any content, including the Needs Grading icons, until assignment grades are unhidden. Note: Assignments that are both anonymous and moderated display as anonymous, though the Grade Detail Tray displays the assignments as being hidden. Moderated hidden assignments can be updated in the Gradebook, but any entered grades will be overwritten once final grades are posted. If you create a Turnitin assignment, the Gradebook displays Turnitin score icons in the Gradebook. To view details of the score, click the icon and view more details in SpeedGrader: Learn more about the Turnitin Similarity Report."

How do I use posting policies in a course?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-posting-policies-in-a-course/ta-p/928,"You can use posting policies in the Gradebook to manage assignment grade visibility for students. Posted grades are visible to students in your course. Hidden grades are visible to you in the course gradebook, but students cannot see them. Posting policies can be set for an entire course and/or individual assignments. Assignment-level posting policies will override the course-level posting policy for that assignment. When a posting policy is set to automatic, grades are automatically posted to students when they are entered. When a posting policy is set to manual, grades must be manually posted to students using the Post grades option before they can be viewed. Posted grades can also be hidden using the Hide grades option. The Hide grades option only hides grades that are currently visible to students. In order to ensure all future assignment grades are hidden, you will need to use a manual posting policy for the assignment or course. Notes:  This flowchart outlines how posting policies work for instructors in their courses. You should select a course posting policy based on your general grade posting preference. You can then set posting policies for individual assignments as needed. You can also hide previously posted grades, especially if you need to fix errors or if grades were posted erroneously.  When students have set grade notification settings, they will receive notifications when grades are posted, as indicated in the flowchart.  You can also view this flowchart as an interactive PDF. By default, Canvas courses have an Automatic posting policy [1]. Assignment grades, grading comments and submission annotations are visible to students as soon as grades are entered in the Gradebook or submitted in SpeedGrader. Alternatively, you can select a Manual posting policy for your course [2]. Assignment grades, grading comments and submission annotations are hidden from students until manually posted. Submission Annotations alone will not trigger the option to post grades; a grade or grading comment would need to be entered. Students can see peer review comments when assignment grades are hidden. However, students can only see instructor comments if the instructor posts grades or submission comments. Learn how to select a course posting policy.  You can also select grade posting policies for individual assignments. When you set an individual assignment posting policy, the course posting policy is overridden for that assignment.   For example, if you use an Automatic course posting policy, you may wish to hide assignment grades for a specific assignment until all submissions are graded.

How do I hide grades that were previously posted in the Gradebook? ,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-hide-grades-that-were-previously-posted-in-the/ta-p/721,"The Hide Grades feature only affects previously posted grades for an assignment. Best practice suggests that instructors should use this feature sparingly (i.e. to hide grades posted in error). To hide all grades upon entry until you are ready to post them for student view, please set a manual posting policy for your assignment.    If you need to hide grades or submission comments that have already posted for students to view, you can hide grades and/or comments in the gradebook or in SpeedGrader. This lesson explains how to hide grades for an assignment that has already been graded and is currently displaying grades to students.  The Hide Grades feature only affects previously entered grades and submission comments. If you want newly-entered grades to be hidden from students, you can set a manual posting policy for an assignment or set a manual posting policy for a course. Assignment-level posting policies override course-level policies for that assignment. When you hide assignment grades and submission comments, the student grades page displays a visibility icon so students know the assignment grade is hidden. Students will be unable to view their grades, including grade and score changes, instructor submission comments, Canvas DocViewer comments, and curved grades for the assignment, until the assignment grades are posted. Additionally, students will not receive grade or instructor comment notifications until the assignment grades are posted.  In Gradebook exports and reports, hidden grades are part of unposted grades. The Hide Grades feature should only be used to temporarily hide grades and comments from student view while grading is in progress. It should not be used to conceal grades for longer than reasonably necessary. If you do not want students to be able to view their total grade, you can hide the total grade from students. Learn more about managing grade visibility in your course and view the interactive Student Grade Visibility Flowchart. Notes:  In Course Navigation, click the Grades link.

How do I enter and edit grades in the Gradebook?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-enter-and-edit-grades-in-the-Gradebook/ta-p/724,"Most likely you will access SpeedGrader to enter grades. The grades will appear in the Gradebook when you are done. However, you can manually enter and edit grades in the Gradebook.  Assignments in the Gradebook are always shown with the assignment's point value. However, you can change the assignment to display grades for a specific grading type. You can also use a CSV file to import grades.  When an assignment score is entered as a letter grade in the Gradebook, the percentage score for the assignment is the upper limit of the range assigned to that letter grade in the grading scheme. If a final grade override is entered as a letter grade, the percentage score for the assignment is the lower limit of the range assigned to that letter grade in the grading scheme.  For example, your course grading scheme may designate a range of 86% to 89% for a B+ letter grade. Entering a B+ for an assignment would assign a percentage of 89% but entering a B+ for a final grade override would assign a percentage of 86%. To ensure students receive a specific percentage for an assignment or final grade, enter the assignment score or grade override as a percentage. Notes: In Course Navigation, click the Grades link. Locate the student name and assignment where you want to enter a grade. Grades are entered according to the assignment's Display Grade setting.

How do I curve grades in the Gradebook?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-curve-grades-in-the-Gradebook/ta-p/745,"You can use the Gradebook to curve grades for an assignment. In the academic community, curving grades is advisable if only a certain number of students can pass, or when you require a fixed distribution of grades distributed throughout the class.  To curve grades, Canvas asks for an average curve score and then adjusts the scores as a bell curve 66% around the average score. For instance, if the average score is the equivalent of a C, Canvas would distribute mostly C- and C+ scores, distributing outward down the curve to Bs and Ds, and then ultimately As and Fs. This type of scoring creates a predictable distribution, but it means that students will compete against their classmates for scoring. To learn more about how curved grades are calculated, view the Curving Grades in Canvas resource document. Note: In Course Navigation, click the Grades link. Hover over the assignment column header and click the Options icon. Click the Curve Grades link. In the Average Score field [1], type the average grade for the curve score. The graph above the Average Score field will change depending on what score is entered and give you an approximation of what the new scores would look like [2]. You can adjust the average score as necessary to produce a desired grading outcome.  You can assign zeros to students who did not submit their assignments by clicking the Assign zeroes to unsubmitted students checkbox [3]. To curve grades, click the Curve Grades button [4].

How do I apply a Missing Submission policy in the Gradebook?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-apply-a-Missing-Submission-policy-in-the-Gradebook/ta-p/963,"The Missing Submission policy lets you automatically apply a grade for all missing submissions in the Gradebook. A submission is labeled missing when the due date has passed and it has not been submitted. Only submissions with a status of Missing will be affected by the Missing Submission policy. The Missing Submission policy is set per course. The Missing Submission policy allows you to define a grade that will be granted for missing submissions as a percentage of the total points possible. The percent entered is multiplied by the total points possible on the assignment and the resulting value will be awarded to missing submissions. For example, if the Missing submission grade is set to 20% and the assignment is worth 10 points, all missing submissions for that assignment will be awarded a grade of 2 points (10 points possible x 20% = 2 points awarded). To award all missing submissions with a grade of 0, the Missing submission grade can be set to 0%. Notes: In Course Navigation, click the Grades link. Click the Settings icon.  In Gradebook Settings, view the Late Policies tab. Click the Automatically apply grade for missing submissions checkbox. Selecting this checkbox will automatically apply the grade you set for any missing submissions in the course.  Set a percentage in the Grade percentage for missing submissions field.  Click the Apply Settings button. View the affected grades in the Gradebook. In the Grade Detail Tray, you can view details about the submission. When a submission applies to a missing policy, the Grade Detail Tray displays the given grade. To remove the late penalty from a submission, enter a grade in the grade field.

How do I apply a Late Submission policy in the Gradebook?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-apply-a-Late-Submission-policy-in-the-Gradebook/ta-p/965,"The Late Submission policy allows you to automatically deduct points on all late submissions. A submission is labeled late when it has been submitted past the due date. Only assignments with a status of Late will be affected by the Late Submission policy. The late policy will be applied to a submission when it is graded. Late Submission policies only apply to the course in which they are configured. Late Submission policies will affect previously graded assignments, but do not affect assignments in closed grading periods or submissions for students with concluded enrollments. Disabling a Late Submission policy will not remove late penalties from previously graded assignments. The Late Submission policy allows you to define a percentage of the total points possible on an assignment that will be deducted for late submissions. Points can be deducted per day or hour the submission is late. For example, if the Deduct field is set to 10%, the interval is selected for Day, and the assignment is worth 10 points, 1 point will be deducted per day. If a submission is 2 days late, and the student is awarded full points, their final grade on the assignment would be 8 points (2 days late x 1 point deduction per day = 2 point Late Penalty). To calculate a late penalty, Canvas rounds up the day or hour to the next whole number. For example, you may set a 10% per day late submission policy. If a student submits a 10-point assignment 1.3 days late, the late penalty will round 1.3 days up to 2 days. The student's score will reflect a 20% (2 point) late submission deduction. Additionally, you can define the lowest possible grade threshold for a late policy. The lowest possible grade percentage is the lowest score a student can receive when late policy deductions are applied to grades entered above that percentage. Any grade awarded equal to or below that percentage will not receive late policy deductions.  For example, if the Late Submission policy is set to deduct 10% per day for late submissions, and a student submits 8 days late to an assignment worth 10 points, the student's grade would be 2 points if they were awarded full credit on the assignment (8 days late x 1 point deducted per day = 8 point Late Penalty). However, if the Lowest grade possible is set to 60%, the student's grade will be adjusted to 6 points. Any grades awarded that are less than or equal to 6 will not have late policies applied. Notes: In Course Navigation, click the Grades link. Click the Settings icon. In Gradebook Settings, view the Late Policies tab. Click the Automatically apply deduction to late submissions checkbox.  Note: Selecting this checkbox will automatically apply the deduction you set for any late submissions in the course that have previously been graded as well as apply to future late submissions you grade. To set the percentage you want late submissions to be deducted, set a percentage in the Late Submission Deduction field [1]. Then set the interval for which you would like Canvas to deduct points in the Deduction Interval drop-down menu [2]. Available interval options are Day or Hour. To manage the lowest possible grade threshold for the late policy, enter a percentage in the Lowest possible grade field. The lowest possible grade percentage is the lowest score a student can receive when late policy deductions are applied to grades entered above that percentage. Any grade awarded equal to or below that percentage will not receive late policy deductions. Click the Apply Settings button.  View the affected grades in the Gradebook. In the Grade Detail Tray, you can view details about the student's grade and adjust settings on each student's individual submission.  In the Grade info section [1], you can view or edit the grade you awarded the student for their submission, the late penalty deduction, and the student's final grade on the assignment. In the Status section [2], you can view how many days late the student submitted the assignment and adjust the amount of days late in the interval field. You can also manually change the submission to a status other than Late, but changing the status will remove any late penalties that had been automatically applied to the student's submission. If you set a late policy, and then adjust any of the parameters, Canvas will display a warning to notify you that changing the late policy will affect previously graded submissions. To exclude a submission from the late penalty you will have to manually change a submission's status to something other than late in the Grade Detail Tray."

Additionally, you can view a summary of the grade before it was changed [5], after it was changed [6], and the current grade for the assignment [7]. Note:  If you are grading in a course where you can only interact with users in your same section, the Gradebook history page will only display results for users within your same section.  Any grade changes related to an anonymously graded assignment do not include student names in the search results [1]. If the anonymous grading option is removed from the assignment at a later time, the Gradebook History page displays an icon showing that the assignment was previously graded anonymously [2]. Note: Posting grades for an anonymous assignment will remove anonymity from the assignment.

How do I use the Learning Mastery Gradebook to view outcome results in a course from the Gradebook?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-the-Learning-Mastery-Gradebook-to-view-outcome/ta-p/774,"The Learning Mastery Gradebook helps instructors and admins assess the outcome standards being used in Canvas courses. This gradebook helps institutions measure student learning for accreditation and better assess the needs of their students.   The default view in the Learning Mastery Gradebook is to view all students at the same time, but you can also view students individually using Learning Mastery Gradebook Individual View. Note: The Learning Mastery Gradebook is currently a course opt-in feature. To enable this gradebook, visit the Feature Options tab in Course Settings. In Course Navigation, click the Grades link. Click the Gradebook menu [1], then click the Learning Mastery Gradebook link [2]. The Learning Mastery Gradebook is organized like the assignments gradebook with the student names and sections on the left [1]. Similar to the assignments gradebook, you can click a student's name to link to their Grades page. Each column consists of a course outcome and the outcome grade for each student [2]. Also like the assignments gradebook, the columns can be sorted, resized, and reordered. Click an outcome column heading to sort the outcome by student name [3]. The Learning Mastery Gradebook also contains a sidebar that shows the outcome levels for the course [4]. The sidebar can be minimized and expanded by toggling the gray arrow icon at the top of the sidebar. You can filter outcomes or students that have no outcome results [5]. You can also export a report of student outcomes [6]. The Learning Mastery Gradebook displays 20 students per page. Use the numbered page navigation buttons to view additional students on other pages [7]. Note: The Hide outcomes and Hide students filters persist for the course while using the same web browser. The Gradebook has two views. The Learning Mastery Gradebook allows you to see all students and outcomes at the same time. The Individual Gradebook allows instructors to assess one student and one outcome at a time and is fully accessible for screen readers. Both views retain the same Gradebook settings. You can switch Gradebook views at any time.  Learn more about the Learning Mastery Gradebook Individual View. Individual student scores within each outcome are based on outcome values. The first number indicates the score the student earned. The second number indicates the mastery threshold, which is the minimum the students need to achieve mastery for the outcome. For instance, if a student earns a score of 5/3, the student has earned 2 points above the base mastery threshold of 3 points [1]. If a student achieves a score of 2/3, the student has not achieved enough points to reach the mastery threshold [2]. Note: To view scores of inactive or concluded enrollments or unassessed student scores, click the Options icon in the Students column [3].  Hover over the outcome title to view a breakdown of a specific outcome. The circle graph shows how the individual student scores were divided into the outcomes criterion ratings.  Scores are color-coded to show outcomes and the level attained by each student: exceeds mastery (dark green) meets mastery (light green), near mastery (yellow), and well below mastery (red). Toggle the boxes in the sidebar to filter scores for a specific level. Score levels are calculated based on half of the outcome mastery threshold. For example, if the mastery threshold is 3 points, half of 3 is 1.5. Scores between 1.6 and 2.9 are counted near mastery, while scores less than 1.5 are considered remedial.  Therefore, a student score of 2/3 would be above 1.5 and count as near mastery. Outcome statistics for the entire course or a course section can be viewed according to course average, course median, or course mode. Select the preferred statistic from the drop-down menu next to the score indicator for each outcome.  The course average is calculated by adding all the earned scores then dividing the total of the mastery scores. The course mode is calculated by finding the score that occurs most often. The course median is calculated by sorting the scores in ascending order, then finding the middle score. These course statistics also display color-coded level results based on the outcome results. Note: If an outcome is aligned to multiple items, the gradebook statistics will always generate from the student’s highest outcome score within that course. Click the All Sections drop-down menu to view by section [1]. Click the Export report link to download a CSV file of the Learning Mastery Gradebook [2]. The student learning outcomes report will include the following columns in the CSV file: Note: All learning outcomes in the Learning Mastery Gradebook will be included in the report.  On the Student Grades page, you can choose to let each student see his or her outcome scores by clicking the Learning Mastery tab. Students can view the outcomes and expand them to view individual outcome items.  To show students their outcome scores, visit Course Settings and open the Feature Options tab. Then enable the Student Learning Mastery Gradebook feature option.  Note: Outcome names are the same as in the Learning Mastery Gradebook unless you create a custom name for the student view.

You can expand each group and see which students are assigned to each group in the group set, if any, by clicking the arrow next to the group name [1]. Once students are participating in a group, you can open the group Options menu and view content and activity within a group [2]. If a group includes an inactive student, a label displays next to the student's name. Inactive student group submissions can still be graded in SpeedGrader, but students do not receive any notifications about their assignment and cannot view course grades.

Once you create modules, you can add content items, set prerequisites, and add requirements. Learn more about Modules. Note: If the Course Home Page is set to modules, modules can be added and managed directly from the Course Home Page. In Course Navigation, click the Modules link. Click the Add Module button. Type a name in the Module Name field. If you want to restrict the module until a specific date, you can lock the module. If you have added at least one module to your course, you can require a prerequisite module. A prerequisite module means students must complete the added modules before they can view the new module. Click the Add Module button. View your created module. To add items to your module, click the Add icon [1] or drag and drop to add files to an empty module [2]."
How do I publish or unpublish a module as an instructor?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-publish-or-unpublish-a-module-as-an-instructor/ta-p/571,"As an instructor, you can publish or unpublish a module in a course. Unpublished modules are invisible to students.  Modules control the entire flow of your course and its content. When you add items to a Module, please be aware that an unpublished module overrides the state of individual module items.  For instance, if you add a published Discussion to an unpublished Module, students cannot view the Discussion on the Modules page. However, they will still be able to see the Discussion in other areas of Canvas, such as the Syllabus and the Calendar, but they will not be able to open or participate in the Discussion. Please be aware of these potential scenarios when adding course content to a Module. Modules also supports publishing or unpublishing files, in addition to setting a file as restricted. The restricted status applies to files only and can hide files from students. However, please be aware that restricted files may still be visible to students when they are added to modules. Learn more about restricting files in Canvas. In Course Navigation, click the Modules link. On the Index page, you can view the state of each module. Green icons indicate the module is published [1]. Gray icons indicate unpublished modules [2]. You can change the status of a module by using the module's publishing drop-down menu. To publish a module, click the module's publishing drop-down menu [1]. To bulk publish the entire module and all its items, click the Publish module and all items option [2]. To only publish the module and not the module items, click the Publish module only option [3]. Note: Bulk publishing files in a module is only available when File Copyright is enabled and usage rights are set or disabled in a course. To unpublish a module and all its items, click the module's publishing drop-down menu [1] and click the Unpublish module and all items option [2]. Note: Bulk unpublish is not available for any files within a module. You can view and change the status of individual module content items as well. Although publishing a module will also publish all module items, you can manually unpublish individual module items later. Students cannot view unpublished module items as part of a published module. Learn more about managing assignments, quizzes, discussions, pages, and files.  If you add a restricted file as a module content item, restricted files appear with a lock icon. Restricted files act as published files and can be viewed by students (depending on the restriction setting). Learn more about restricting files in Canvas. Note: Please be aware that an unpublished module overrides the state of individual module items. If an item is published within an unpublished module, students cannot view the item on the Modules page but they can still view the published items in other areas of Canvas. However, they will not be able to interact with the item until the module is published. Students cannot see any of the actions involved with published status, such as published and unpublished icons and setting icons. Students will only see published modules and available module content items, which are displayed in gray text."

How do I use Mastery Paths in course modules?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-Mastery-Paths-in-course-modules/ta-p/906,"Mastery Paths allows you to customize learning experiences for students based on performance. You can enable Mastery Paths to automatically assign coursework based on the score achieved for a previous assignment. This provides multiple opportunities to show and achieve mastery in a course. Mastery Paths is based on differentiated assignments, which allows targeted learning activities to be assigned to different users and sections. With Mastery Paths, assignments are differentiated to individual students automatically and no additional work is required aside from grading student assignments as usual. After the initial assignment has been graded (either manually or automatically), the student’s score designates which conditional item(s) they are assigned as a learning path. For example, a learning path can assign one set of items to students who score at or above 70% and another set to students who score below 70%. If Student A scores an 70% or higher, they can access Page 1, Page 2, Assignment 1, and Assignment 2. You can require Student A to read both pages and complete at least one assignment. If Student B scores less than 70%, they can access Page 1, Page 3, Page 4, and Assignment 1. You can require Student B to read all three pages and complete the assignment in order to achieve mastery of the subject. When creating Mastery Paths, source assignments and all differentiated course items should be created, and differentiated items should be designated as conditional items before publishing the course. Weighted Grading If you use weighted grading in your course, additional course work may affect student's total grades. However, grade calculations are based on the assignments assigned to and completed by the student; students are not penalized for any assignments that are not assigned to them. If you are concerned about grade variances with point values, you may want to review the conditional assignments assigned to each Mastery Path and try to balance out grading totals in each path. Additionally you could evaluate student progress and add individual students to assignments as necessary that they can complete to improve their grade. Notes:  In Course Navigation, click the Modules link. The Mastery Path process currently only originates from the course Modules page. Before you can designate source assignments and conditional items for a Mastery Path, all course assignments and pages should be developed and added to Modules as module items. Mastery Paths can be created from module structures in existing courses or new course content. Indenting module items can be used to help organize the module's structure and visually show which items should be conditional items in a Mastery Path. Graded assignments, graded discussions, or graded quizzes may be used as the source content for a Mastery Path. A student's source content score determines which conditional item(s) they are assigned.  Any course item except for practice quizzes and ungraded surveys may be designated as a conditional item in a Mastery Path. Notes:  Because content pages do not require grading, content pages cannot be used as source content and can only be added to a Mastery Path as conditional content. However, a page must be allowed for Mastery Paths before it can be added as a conditional item. A Mastery Path originates from an assignment assigned to everyone, such as a pre-test or an introductory assignment.   The Mastery Paths configuration page allows you to add conditional content items to the source content item. Conditional content items are selected from the list of module items you have already added to the module. These items are then assigned to specific students through conditional rules in three scoring ranges. After the source content assignment has been graded (either manually or automatically), the student’s score designates which conditional item(s) they are assigned as a learning path. By default, assignments in Canvas are assigned to Everyone, which means all students will be able to view the assignment in their Modules page. Once conditional content items have been added to a Mastery Path, the conditional assignments must be assigned to Mastery Paths. The Mastery Paths assignment designates the assignment for conditional release only, and the assignment will only display to students whose source content scores fall in a range that releases the conditional assignment to them. When you create Mastery Paths for your course, students see content added to their Modules page as they move through the course. When the course begins, they will only be able to see items that have been published and assigned to Everyone or assigned specifically to them. In contrast, courses that do not use Mastery Paths display all content in the Module, even if the content is locked. Once a Mastery Path source assignment has been graded (either automatically by Canvas or manually in SpeedGrader), the conditional item(s) will automatically display in the student’s Modules page based on the source item’s scoring range. If a Mastery Path source assignment scoring range includes an Or option, students must choose which conditional item(s) they wish to complete before proceeding.  Notes:  When a student is assigned or selects a conditional item, the conditional assignment automatically adds the student’s name to the assignment as being differentiated to that student. Once students complete a source content item for a Mastery Path, you can view the Mastery Paths breakdown. Each scoring range includes a link that shows the number of students in each range. You can click the name of a student in the range, view the student’s source content submission and score, and send a message to the student."
How do I allow a page to be a Mastery Path module item?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-allow-a-page-to-be-a-Mastery-Path-module-item/ta-p/858,"If you want to add a page to a Mastery Path in a module, you must first allow the page in Mastery Paths. Otherwise, the page will not appear as a conditional item when you add an item to a Mastery Path. Notes:  In Course Navigation, click the Modules link. Click the name of the page in the module. Click the Edit button. At the bottom of the page, click the Allow in mastery paths checkbox. Click the Save button."
How do I add conditional content to a Mastery Path source item?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-add-conditional-content-to-a-Mastery-Path-source-item/ta-p/854,"Mastery Paths release conditional content to students based on scoring-range rules. After the source assignment or assessment is graded (either manually or automatically), the student’s score designates which conditional item(s) are assigned as a learning path. For instance, a student who scores above 90% on an assignment could be assigned more advanced work, while a student who scores below 60% could view assignments designed for content clarification and improvement. Please note that resubmitted source items may affect conditional paths, as updated grades may change the conditional assignments released to the student. Any graded assignment, graded discussion, or graded quiz may be used as the source content for a Mastery Path.  Any course item except for practice quizzes, ungraded surveys, and external tool assignments may be designated as a conditional item in a Mastery Path. Course items such as links, files, and media content must be embedded in a page or assignment to be used as conditional content in Mastery Paths. A Mastery Path should originate from an assignment assigned to everyone, such as a pre-test or an introductory assignment. Once you have added conditional content to a Mastery Path source assignment, you must differentiate each conditional assignment for Mastery Paths. Notes:  In Course Navigation, click the Modules link. Locate the item where you want to add a Mastery Path and click the Options icon [1]. Click the Mastery Paths option [2]. Note: Items that cannot originate a Mastery Path, including content pages and non-graded items, will not display the Mastery Paths settings option. The assignment grade display and point value are shown at the top of the Mastery Path page [1].  The Mastery Paths tab displays three ranges for conditional content [2]. The ranges match the grade display set for the assignment—points, percentage, letter grade, or GPA. The ranges default to 70%, 40%, and 0% of the assignment’s point value [2]. rounded up respectively. For instance, an assignment worth 25 points defaults to ranges of 25–18 points, 18–10 points, and 10–0 points.  Each range can be customized to a range outside the default values. To adjust a range, click the value and enter the new conditional range. Note: Range values must be set in order from highest to lowest. Empty values are not allowed. Select the range where you want to add conditional content items and click the Add button. Any existing course item that can be used in a Mastery Path can be added as conditional content.  In the content window, you can search for content by name in the Search field [1], or filter items by type using the All Items drop-down menu [2]. If a content item does not display in the content window, the item cannot be added as a conditional release item. Notes:  To add a content item, select the checkbox next to the item [1]. You can select multiple items at one time. Click the Add Items button [2]. Select another range and add the appropriate content items [1]. You can add up to three item groups to each range using existing items in a course as conditional items [2]. Conditional items may be added in the form of individual item requirements for a student to choose from, or as a group of items a student must complete. Note:  An item may be added to more than one range. An item that is already added in the range will be crossed out in the content window. Multiple conditional items within a range can be mixed and matched as individual items, grouped items, or both. Items can also be reordered within the range by dragging and dropping in the preferred order [1]. You can also edit an item, move an item, or delete an item from the item's options menu [2]. When more than one conditional item is added to the same range, the items default to be completed together as indicated by the And (ampersand) button [1]. Students who complete the assignment and score in a range with joined assignments must complete all the assignments in the conditional path. If you want to give students a choice between assignments in a path, a range's items can be set to complete only one item or group in the path. To create a path option, click the And button. The items will separate and the And will change to an Or button [2]. Students who complete the assignment and score in a range with an Or designation can select which item(s) to complete as part of the conditional path. To help select an assignment path, students will be able to view the descriptions of each assignment. When you are finished adding conditional items, click the Save button."
How do I assign a conditional assignment for students to complete in Mastery Paths?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-assign-a-conditional-assignment-for-students-to/ta-p/1025,"By default, assignments in Canvas are assigned to Everyone, which means all students will be able to view the item in their Modules page. Once you have added conditional assignments to a Mastery Path, you must designate the assignment for conditional release by assigning it to Mastery Paths. Mastery Path assignments only display to students whose scores fall in a range that releases the assignment to them. To confirm that all conditional content items have been assigned to Mastery Paths correctly, you can use the Test Student to view the students' Modules page by enabling Student View. The only course items that should be visible to the Test Student are items assigned to Everyone. Therefore, if the Test Student can view a conditional item without having completed any coursework, the assignment may not have been edited and assigned to Mastery Paths.

How do I align an outcome with a question bank?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-align-an-outcome-with-a-question-bank/ta-p/790,"You can align any outcome in your course to a question bank. Outcomes can be aligned with a question bank for additional assessment and measurable performance. To align an outcome, the outcome must already exist for your course. You can align outcomes created at the account level, or learn how to create course outcomes. The Learning Mastery Gradebook mastery score for an aligned outcome calculates based only on questions from the aligned question bank in a quiz. The mastery score is calculated by weighing the percentage score of correct answers from the question bank against the mastery score set when aligning the question bank to the outcome. For example, if the outcome is set to mastery at 60%, a student must score 60% or higher in order to master the outcome. In Course Navigation, click the Quizzes link. Click the Options icon [1] and click the Manage Question Banks link [2]. Click the title of the Question Bank to be aligned with the Outcome. Click the Align Outcome button. Choose the Outcome from the listed Outcomes [1]. Set the mastery level by typing in the percent field [2]. The mastery level is the percentage score that a student has to earn before you consider the student to have mastered the outcome. For example, a mastery score of 60 means that the student has to earn a 60% or higher on the aligned quiz questions. This score is only calculated using questions from the aligned question bank.

How do I use the Learning Mastery Gradebook to view outcome results in a course?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-the-Learning-Mastery-Gradebook-to-view-outcome/ta-p/775,"The Learning Mastery Gradebook helps instructors and admins assess the outcome standards being used in Canvas courses. This gradebook helps institutions measure student learning for accreditation and better assess the needs of their students.   The default view in the Learning Mastery Gradebook is to view all students at the same time, but you can also view students individually using Individual View. Notes:  In Course Navigation, click the Grades link. Click the Gradebook menu [1], then click the Learning Mastery Gradebook link [2]. The Learning Mastery Gradebook is organized like the assignments gradebook with the student names and sections on the left [1]. Similar to the assignments gradebook, you can click a student's name to link to their Grades page. Each column consists of a course outcome and the outcome grade for each student [2]. Also like the assignments gradebook, the columns can be sorted, resized, and reordered. Click an outcome column heading to sort the outcome by student name [3]. The Learning Mastery Gradebook also contains a sidebar that shows the outcome levels for the course [4]. The sidebar can be minimized and expanded by toggling the gray arrow icon at the top of the sidebar. You can filter outcomes or students that have no outcome results [5]. You can also export a report of student outcomes [6]. The Learning Mastery Gradebook displays 20 students per page. Use the numbered page navigation buttons to view additional students on other pages [7]. Note: The Hide outcomes and Hide students filters persist for the course while using the same web browser. The Gradebook has two views. The Learning Mastery Gradebook allows you to see all students and outcomes at the same time. The Individual Gradebook allows instructors to assess one student and one outcome at a time and is fully accessible for screen readers. Both views retain the same Gradebook settings. You can switch Gradebook views at any time.  Learn more about the Learning Mastery Gradebook Individual View. Individual student scores within each outcome are based on outcome values. The first number indicates the score the student earned. The second number indicates the mastery threshold, which is the minimum the students need to achieve mastery for the outcome. For instance, if a student earns a score of 5/3, the student has earned 2 points above the base mastery threshold of 3 points [1]. If a student achieves a score of 2/3, the student has not achieved enough points to reach the mastery threshold [2]. Note: To view scores of inactive or concluded enrollments or unassessed student scores, click the Options icon in the Students column [3].  Hover over the outcome title to view a breakdown of a specific outcome. The circle graph shows how the individual student scores were divided into the outcomes criterion ratings.  Scores are color-coded to show outcomes and the level attained by each student. View the outcome levels and colors in the sidebar. To filter scores for specific learning mastery levels, click the outcome level in the sidebar. Score levels are calculated based on half of the outcome mastery threshold. For example, if the mastery threshold is 3 points, half of 3 is 1.5. Scores between 1.6 and 2.9 are counted near mastery, while scores less than 1.5 are considered remedial. Therefore, a student score of 2/3 would be above 1.5 and count as near mastery. Note: Outcome colors and levels can be customized for your institution by your admin. Outcome statistics for the entire course or a course section can be viewed according to course average, course median, or course mode. Select the preferred statistic from the drop-down menu next to the score indicator for each outcome.  The course average is calculated by adding all the earned scores then dividing the total of the mastery scores. The course mode is calculated by finding the score that occurs most often. The course median is calculated by sorting the scores in ascending order, then finding the middle score. These course statistics also display color-coded level results based on the outcome results. Note: If an outcome is aligned to multiple items, the gradebook statistics will always generate from the student’s highest outcome score within that course. Click the All Sections drop-down menu to view by section [1]. Click the Export report link to download a CSV file of the Learning Mastery Gradebook [2]. The student learning outcomes report will include the following columns in the CSV file:   Note: All learning outcomes in the Learning Mastery Gradebook will be included in the report.

How do I add users to a course?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-add-users-to-a-course/ta-p/1119,"You may have already added user enrollments to your course in the Course Setup Checklist. However, you can invite users to join your course at any time if the Add People button is available in the People page. If your institution uses SIS Imports, you do not need to add any users who are part of your institution's records for the course. They will be added to the course by your admin.  Course Invitations When an enrollment is manually added to the course, Canvas generates a course invitation once the course is published. The user must accept the course invitation to participate in the course. Until the user accepts the course invitation, the user's status will display as pending. Note that when a user receives an enrollment invitation for a custom role, the invitation displays the name of the base role. In Canvas accounts, admins can allow Open Registration, which allows you to add users to a course even if the users do not yet have a Canvas account. The user will create an account as part of accepting the course invitation. However, if Open Registration is not enabled, you can only add users to your course who already have an account in Canvas. If your institution is part of a trust account, searching for a user may display a search result associated with another institution. Trust accounts allow users to be added with the same credentials across multiple institutions. Users are not sent a course invitation until the course start date. (The start date is commonly the term date, unless the term is being overridden by a specific course or section date in Course Settings.) Additionally, courses must be published for students to receive course invitations.  Please note that users invited to a course in an observer role are not sent a course invitation unless they do not already have a Canvas account. Observer enrollments without a Canvas account must create an account before they can log in to the course. User Roles When manually adding users to a course, you can add a user into any available role, including custom roles as created by your admin. If you are not sure about what permissions are allowed for a specific role in your institution, please contact your Canvas admin.  Standard roles include Teaching Assistants (TAs), Observers, and Designers:  Multiple Sections If you want to add the same person to different sections, you can enroll them in one section and then add them to additional sections later.    Notes:  In Course Navigation, click the People link. Click the Add People button. To add a user, you can search for users with up to one of three options: email address, login ID, or SIS ID.  To select a search option, click the button for your preferred search method.  Note: If you are copying and pasting user information from a spreadsheet, you do not have to filter out information that does not apply to your search option. For instance, if you copy in a line with an email address and login ID and select the login ID search option, Canvas will disregard the email address and only search for users with the entered login ID.  However, please note that currently Canvas only supports single-line entries separated by commas; multiple-line entries separated by spaces will be supported in a future release. By default, the search field is set to search by email address [1]. In the text field [2], enter the email address for the user. You can copy and paste multiple users at one time, such as from a comma separated value (CSV) file, by placing a comma or line break between users. When searching by email address, the user's institution-assigned email address should be used whenever possible. For the majority of institutions, each user should have an email address associated with the user's account and may be the same as the user's login ID. Instructors can add users through one of several formats, which also support user names:  Email addresses can be enclosed by less than ( < ) or greater than ( > ) symbols, although it is not required. To add a user by login ID, select the login ID button [1]. In the text field [2], enter the login ID for the user. You can copy and paste multiple login IDs at one time by placing a comma or line break between login IDs.  When searching by login ID, you should use the login ID format found in the Canvas login page for your institution (e.g. username, student ID, etc.). The example format in the login ID field may differ from the format used in your institution. If you are not sure how to format users for your institution in the text field, please contact your Canvas admin. Login IDs do not support entries that include a user's name; any entered content in the Login ID search field will be included as the search content.  If your institution allows you to view SIS IDs in your course, you can also search for users by SIS ID.  To search for users by SIS ID, select the SIS ID button [1]. In the text field [2], enter the SIS ID for the user. You can copy and paste multiple SIS IDs at one time by placing a comma or line break between SIS IDs.  SIS IDs do not support entries that include a user's name; any entered content in the SIS ID search field will be included as the search content.  Note: The SIS ID button only displays for users with SIS permissions. In the Role drop-down menu [1], assign the user(s) a role for the course based on available course roles. In the Section drop-down menu [2], assign the user(s) a section in the course. If you want to limit the user(s) to only interact with other users in their section, click the Can interact... checkbox [3]. Click the Next button [4]. Note: If you are adding multiple users at the same time, all users inherit the same role and section. If Canvas finds an existing user, you can confirm the user before adding the user to the course [1].  The user's name displays in the page along with the user's information you used in the user search. Although Canvas may display additional search columns, existing information in a user's account will not be displayed. When you are ready, click the Add Users button [2].  If Canvas did not find your intended user, you can click the Start Over button [3]. If Open Registration is disabled for your institution and Canvas is not able to find a match for the user(s), Canvas will notify you that a match was not found.  To try a new search, click the Back button. If Open Registration is enabled for your institution and Canvas is not able to find a match for the user(s), you can choose to add the user(s) to your course. Canvas may ask you if you want to create a new user account if the user does not have a username in the course's account, the user's email address is linked to another user within the account, or the institution does not use delegated authentication.  To add all users in the search results, click the Select All checkbox [1]. To add an individual user, click the checkbox next to the user's name [2]. If you searched for users in a format that includes a user’s name, any selected users will automatically include the users' names in the enrollment list [1]. You can make adjustments to the user name, if necessary. If the user’s name was not included, you can choose to add a name to associate with the user’s email address [2]. Otherwise, Canvas will use the user’s email address as the user’s name. Click the Next button [3]. If you add a user via email and their email address has not been verified, you may see an error message. If you are unable to add a user with an unverified email to your course, you must wait for the user to verify their email address, or add the user by either SIS ID or Login ID. If you want to add a user via a login or SIS ID, you can choose to add a name to associate with the user [1]. You are also required to include an email address for the user [2].  If no user name is entered, Canvas will use the user’s email address as the user’s name. Once you have entered an email address, you can click the Next button [3]. Confirm the users you are adding to the course via your selected search method. Click the Add Users button. Until the user accepts the course invitation, the user's status will display as pending. Note that observer invitations will only show as pending if the invited observer does not already have a Canvas account.  If you added a user without a Canvas account, the user can create an account as part of the course invitation process. Once the user has accepted the course invitation, you can interact with the user in the course. You can also send messages to the user via Conversations. If necessary, you may be able to edit a user's role in Canvas.  Note: It could take up to 24 hours for users to receive their invitations. Canvas will not consider the user to be enrolled—and won't recognize the user anywhere in Canvas—until the invitation has been accepted. If necessary, you can resend course invitations."
How do I resend student invitations to a course?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-resend-student-invitations-to-a-course/ta-p/1219,"If a user has been manually added to a course but has not yet accepted the course invitation after a period of time, you can resend the course invitation. You must allow at least 24 hours before resending a course invitation. Note: Users are not sent a course invitation until the course participation start date. (The start date is commonly the term date, unless the term is being overridden by a specific course or section participation date in Course Settings.) Additionally, courses must be published for students to receive course invitations.  In Course Navigation, click the People link.

How do I view a context card for a student in a course?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-view-a-context-card-for-a-student-in-a-course/ta-p/608,"You can click a student's name anywhere in Canvas to view a summary of the student's progress in the course. Context cards do not apply outside a course, such as in the Conversations Inbox. Student context cards provide insights and context about the student. Context cards are meant to be a simplified overview of a student’s progress. The context is generated from grades in the Gradebook and standard page view and participation activity in course analytics. Mobile data is not included unless a user accesses Canvas directly through a mobile browser, or if a user accesses content within the mobile app that redirects to a mobile browser. Context Card Users Context cards only apply to users with student roles; they are not supported for user names where the user is not a student (e.g. observer, TA, or other instructor). Clicking links for non-student roles will always direct to the user’s details page or profile page (if your institution has enabled the Profiles feature). Context Card Link Locations This lesson shows how to view a context card for a student from the People page. Other areas where student names display in courses include announcement and discussion replies, the Gradebook, and the Moderate page for moderated assignments. Current exceptions include links in groups and student links in the Course Analytics page, which link to the student’s individual analytics page. Note: If the final grade override feature is enabled, the override grade will display as the student's current grade. In Course Navigation, click the People link. In the search field [1], search for the name of the student. You can also filter users by student role in the Roles drop-down menu [2]. Click the name of the student. The context card displays in a separate window within the page. At the top of the card, you can view overview information about the student:   Users who have permission to act as other users can also view a Act as User link to quickly act as the student. The grading section gives an overview of the student's course grade. The student's current grade displays as shown in the Gradebook according to grading scheme [1].  For courses using Multiple Grading Periods, the context card only displays the grade for the current grading period. Note that the grading period view in the Gradebook does not influence the grade display; the student context card always displays the current grading period, regardless of whether you view a prior or future grading period. The card also shows the number of missing assignments [2] and late assignments [3]. Missing assignments are based on course analytics data, which generates data for online submission assignments in Canvas. For submissions not submitted online, assignment calculations may not be entirely accurate as they are attempted based on the assignment’s grade and when the assignment was graded. Late assignments are based on assignment due date.  In the Last Graded Items section [4], you can view a maximum of the student's last 10 recently graded assignments along with the assignment’s grade, shown according to grading scheme. If the grading scheme does not fit in the window, the grades default to points. To view the name of an assignment, hover over a graded item [5]. To view submission details for the assignment, click the graded item. The activity section provides an overview of the student's participation compared to other students in the course. It is not meant to be an exact comparison and is based on the standard deviation of the student's participation [1] and page views [2] in the course.  The activity level is indicated by stars that represent no participation, low participation, moderate participation, and high participation. Students with no page views receive zero stars. Students whose participation falls in the lowest quartile of course activity receive one star. Students whose participation falls in the middle two quartiles receive two stars. Students whose participation falls in the top quartile receive three stars.  Participation information may help you quickly identify at-risk students in your course. For instance, a student with both high participation and high page views is probably a high-performance student who submits coursework and participates in course discussions, assignments, and other activities. A student with no participation or page views is most likely not engaged in the course and may need some assistance or participation encouragement. Note: More accurate details about course activity can be viewed by accessing the student's analytics page or user details page, both of which may be available to you to access from the Student overview section of the context card. To close the context card, click the Close icon."

What feature settings can I enable in my user account as an instructor?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/What-feature-settings-can-I-enable-in-my-user-account-as-an/ta-p/1140,"Canvas is continually creating new features to improve your user experience. The majority of improvements will be made available as part of our regular release cycle. However, some features may affect your personal interaction with Canvas. Learn more about User Feature Settings and how to enable them in the manage new features lesson. By default, this feature is set to Off.  The Auto Show Closed Captions feature setting allows you to enable captions added to videos by default for your Canvas account.  Note: Videos embedded from third-party tools, such as Youtube, are not supported. Additionally, embedded Canvas Studio videos are not yet supported.   This feature only displays if your institution has enabled the Canvas course setup tutorial. By default, this feature only displays for new users enrolled as instructors and is set to Off. The Course Set-up Tutorial feature setting allows you to view the course set-up tutorial. When enabled, this feature displays a tutorial in each Course Navigation index page that shows you the purpose of the page and what to do next. The tutorial applies to all of your courses in Canvas where you are enrolled as an instructor.  By default this feature is set to Off. The Disable Alert Notification Timeouts feature setting prevents alert notification pop-ups from timing out. When this feature is enabled, alert notifications in Canvas will display until you manually dismiss the alert. This feature only displays if your institution has enabled confetti for valid links. By default this feature is set to Off. The Disable Celebration Animations feature setting allows you to disable celebration animations that display when you run the link validator in your course. When enabled, celebration animations will no longer display in Canvas. By default this feature is set to Off. The Disable Keyboard Shortcuts feature setting allows you to disable keyboard shortcuts in Modules, Discussions, the Gradebook, and SpeedGrader. Other areas of Canvas will be updated at a future date. This feature allows users who rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation to control their experience in Canvas with keyboard shortcuts. By default this feature is set to Off. The High Contrast UI feature setting allows you to view Canvas using high contrast styles. This feature enhances the color contrast of the user interface (text, buttons, etc.) so they are more distinct and easier to identify in Canvas. However, institutional branding is not supported when this feature is enabled, so you will not be able to view the institution's logo or other elements. You can also enable High Contrast UI from your User Navigation Menu. By default this feature is set to Off. The Microsoft Immersive Reader enhances accessibility and comprehension for any reader. When enabled, the course home page, assignments, pages, and syllabus display an Immersive Reader button. Microsoft Immersive Reader is available for you to enable individually, regardless of the preference set at the account level. However, if the feature is on for the entire account, the account preference overrides your user preference, and your user setting has no effect. To learn more about this feature, see the Microsoft Immersive Reader website. By default this feature is set to On.  The Open to-do items in a new tab feature setting allows you to open Grade Assignment links from your Dashboard To Do list in a new browser tab. Disabling this feature allows you to open Grade Assignment links from your Dashboard To Do list in the existing browser tab. By default this feature is set to Off. The Underline Links feature setting allows you to view Canvas interface links as underlined text. When enabled, this feature underlines hyperlinks in navigation menus, the Dashboard, and page sidebars. This feature setting does not apply to user-generated content links in the Rich Content Editor, which always underlines links for all users. You can set how you want to view separators in CSV export files, depending on your locale or preference. Separator settings are managed through one of three feature settings in User Settings. These settings only apply to compatible spreadsheet exports. The Autodetect field separators feature setting attempts to determine the appropriate field separator as indicated by the language set in the user’s account. For languages where the decimal separator is a dot, (e.g. 1,234.56), autodetection will choose a comma as the field separator. For languages where the decimal separator is a comma, (e.g. 1.234,56), autodetection will choose a semicolon as the field separator. For all other cases, autodetection will choose a comma as the field separator as a default. Note: This feature is automatically disabled if the Use semicolons to separate fields setting is enabled. The Include Byte-Order Mark feature setting generates a specific set of three characters at the beginning of the CSV file. These characters, known as a byte-order mark, help some versions of Microsoft Excel understand that the CSV file is a UTF-8 encoded file. It also tells some localized versions of Excel that they should treat the incoming CSV file as if it were semicolon-separated by default. Because some versions of Excel do not understand or honor the byte-order mark, this feature allows all users to disable generation of this byte-order mark. The Use semicolons to separate fields feature setting generates CSV files with semicolons as the field separators instead of the default comma. When disabled, this feature falls back to behavior determined by the state of the Autodetect field separators setting. Note: This feature is automatically disabled if the Autodetect Field Separators setting is enabled."

You can also download comma separate value (CSV) files to view Student Analysis or Item Analysis for each quiz question. For more detailed information about item analysis limitations and calculations, please refer to the Item Analysis resource document.  For optimum course performance in the Canvas interface, quiz statistics will only generate for quizzes with 100 or fewer unique questions or 1000 total attempts. For instance, a quiz with 200 questions will not generate quiz statistics. However, a quiz with 75 questions will generate quiz statistics until the quiz has reached 1000 attempts. Results greater than these maximum values can be viewed by downloading the Student Analysis report and viewing the CSV file. Notes:  In Course Navigation, click the Quizzes link.

For more detailed information about item analysis limitations and calculations, please refer to the Quiz Item Analysis resource document.  When you generate an analysis report, Canvas shows the last time the report was generated. If there is an error with the report, you can retry the option or cancel the analysis completely. The Student Analysis report includes a tabular representation of each student's answers and the grade awarded for each answer. Notes: Quiz question shows the total percentage of students who answered the quiz question correctly [1].  Each question includes a breakdown with each question answer choice. Correct answer response(s) are shown in a green bar with a check mark [2]; incorrect responses are shown in a black bar [3]. Question types that do not have set answer choices, such as Fill-in-the-Blank questions, display entries other than the correct answer in a black striped bar [4]. The horizontal bars are scaled according to the answer response percentage [5].  Each response also displays the number of respondents who selected the answer [6]. To view the names of the students who selected an answer choice, click the [x respondents] link.  Quiz statistics also show relative grade performance for manually graded essay and file upload quiz question types. Manually graded question types are shown in the same table format as other quiz types.  A manually graded quiz type is marked as correct if it contains a student score greater than or equal to the question points possible.  Grade breakdown responses are shown as the top 27% [1], middle 46% [2], and bottom 27% [3]. The statistics also show submissions that have not yet been graded [4]. However, if all scores are identical, a response category may show more than the percentage number of students (e.g., all students score 100%).  Manually graded questions also include access to SpeedGrader for quick reference [5].  True/False and Multiple Choice quiz questions include an item discrimination index, which provides a measure of how well a single question can tell the difference between students who do well on an exam and those who do not.  It divides students into three groups based on their score on the whole quiz: the top 27%, the middle 46%, and the bottom 27%. The number of correct answers from the bottom group is subtracted from the number of correct answers in the top group, then the total is divided by the size of the group. Lower discrimination scores are scored +0.24 or lower; good scores are +0.25 or higher. An ideal discrimination index shows students who scored higher on the quiz getting the quiz question right, students who scored lower on the quiz getting the quiz question wrong, and students in the middle range on either side. A discrimination index of zero shows all students getting the quiz question right or wrong. Ideally, students who did well on the exam should get the question right. If students do well on the overall exam but not on the question, the question itself may need to be revised."

How do I view a quiz log for a student?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-view-a-quiz-log-for-a-student/ta-p/580,"You can view quiz logs to view the status of your student quizzes. This feature is designed to help you investigate problems that a student may have in the quiz and gain insight into your quiz questions. Quiz logs are not intended to validate academic integrity or identify cheating for a quiz. The quiz starts the log when students begin the quiz, so some logs may show that the quiz is in progress. If you gave the student multiple attempts for a quiz, the log will always show the most recent attempt by default. However, you can view any attempt within the log.  Each attempt will display timestamps and quiz action statuses in the quiz log. If you are looking to investigate potential academic integrity or cheating concerns, we recommend that you first work with the academic affairs office, academic technology office, or other office charged with handling academic misconduct matters within your institution. They can share processes, guidelines, and approved institutional approaches for investigating academic integrity issues that may or may not occur in an online environment. Notes: In Course Navigation, click the Quizzes link. Click the name of a quiz. Click the Options menu [1] and click the Show Student Quiz Results option [2].  Click the name of a student. Click the View Log link. View the session information and the action log for the quiz.  The session information shows the start date and time [1] for the attempt [2].  The action log for the specified attempt will display a status [3] and a timestamp [4] for each quiz action. To refresh the quiz log, click the Refresh icon [5]. Each item in the action log contains a status. Possible action log statuses include: To view responses to a question, click the link to the quiz question number. You can view the number of times the question was answered, as well as each specific attempt at answering the question [1].  To view answers for another quiz question, click the question number [2]. To return to the log, click the Back to log link [3]. The log may show Fill-in-Multiple-Blanks, Matching, Multiple Answers, and Multiple Dropdown questions as being answered at the beginning of the quiz. This action is generated by the autosave component within Canvas quizzes. If a student clicks to answer another question, the quiz will autosave all the questions and show them as being answered. Because of the autosave behavior, the quiz log does not include an accurate log for Fill-in-Multiple-Blanks, Matching, Multiple Answers, and Multiple Dropdown questions. When viewing the question answers in the log, the question will show a null or no answer response for the autosaved answer attempt.    If the student has more than one quiz attempt, the log always shows the last attempt. Prior attempts can be viewed by clicking the number of the attempt."
What options can I use to regrade a quiz in a course?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/What-options-can-I-use-to-regrade-a-quiz-in-a-course/ta-p/1093,"If you accidentally published a quiz that needs to be corrected, you can use quiz regrade to edit existing quiz questions and tell Canvas to recalculate student grades.  Quiz regrade only works with specific quiz question types and only applies to students who have already taken the quiz. Adding or removing a question does not trigger the quiz regrade feature. Additionally, changing the point value for a quiz question also does not trigger a quiz regrade; the student's submitted quiz will show the updated point value, but the current grade won't change in the Gradebook. If you have edited your quiz in one of these three ways, you should moderate the quiz and let the student retake the quiz. This feature only applies for students who have already taken the quiz and only the existing quiz questions have been changed. Once the quiz regrade completes, you will receive an email notification to let you know that the regrade has finished. Currently, quiz regrade is available Multiple Choice, True/False, and Multiple Answers question types.  Quiz regrade does not apply to questions linked to a question bank since questions may be used in more than one quiz.  Additionally, adding or deleting answers from a question with submissions disables the option to regrade that question. When you change the correct answer in a quiz question, Canvas presents up to four quiz regrade options, depending on the question type. Using quiz analytics or student feedback, you may find that students found a question too confusing, or you realized that the question could have been listed with multiple answers when only one was selected. In cases like these, you can select the Award points for both corrected and previously correct answers option to avoid penalizing your students. Notes:  Occasionally an incorrect answer may get marked as the correct answer for a quiz. The Only award points for the corrected answer option allows you to correct the answer and give credit to those who selected the answer that should have been correct.  In some cases it might be appropriate to simply give everyone full credit for a question. Select the Give everyone full credit for this question option. If you need to improve your question or answers for a future quiz, you can select the Update question without regrading option to update a question without regrading the students who have already taken the quiz."

How do I add a rubric in a course?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-add-a-rubric-in-a-course/ta-p/842,"If you cannot find a rubric you want to use in your course, you can create a new rubric. Once you create a rubric, the rubric is saved in your course for future use. You can add the rubric to an assignment and use the rubric for grading and adding comments. You can manage created rubrics in the Manage Rubrics page. This lesson shows how to create a rubric in the Manage Rubrics page. You can also create a rubric directly when adding a rubric to an assignment, and the process is the same. Rubric criteria can include a point range or an individual point value. Note: Currently criterion cannot be reordered after they are added to a rubric. In Course Navigation, click the Rubrics link. Click the Add Rubric button. In the Title field, add a title for the rubric. This title identifies the rubric so it can be easily associated with an assignment, graded discussion, or quiz. The rubric includes one default criterion entry. To edit the criterion description, click the Edit icon. Note: Currently criterion cannot be reordered after they are added to a rubric. If you want to display criterion in a specific order, make sure you create them in the order that you prefer.  Enter a short description for the criterion in the Description field [1]. To add a longer description to the criterion, enter a longer description [2]. The longer description provides students more information about the criterion. Click the Update Criterion button [3]. By default, rubric ratings are created as individual point values. If you want to create a point range instead, click the Range checkbox [1]. Ranges allow you to assign a rating for a range of point options instead of just one point value.  When enabled, the first rating (full marks) shows the total point value in a range format [2]. Each rating displays a maximum and minimum point value. For each rating, the maximum value is assigned as the point value.  Except for the range value display, criterion ranges function the same way as individual point ratings. For instance, a range that includes a maximum of five points and a minimum of three points is assigned the full point value of five points.  Rubric ratings default to 5 points, awarding 5 points for full rubric marks and 0 points for no rubric marks. If you want to adjust the total point value of the criterion, enter the number of points in the Points field [1]. The first rating (full marks) updates to the new total point value and any incremental ratings adjust appropriately [2]. To add a new rating for the criterion, click the Add icon. In the Edit Rating window, complete the rating criterion description. By default, the Rating Score field displays the point value between the two existing ranges [1]. To change the point value for the rating score, enter the new point value in the Rating Score field. Points can be whole (1, 5, 10) or decimal (0.3, 0.5, 2.75) numbers. However, if you are using a range, point values should be whole numbers. In the Rating Title field [2], enter a title for the rating. In the Rating Description field [3], enter a description for the rating. Click the Update Rubric button [4]. To edit a rating, click the Edit icon [1]. Editing a specific rating value affects the full point value for the criterion. If you adjust the point value of a rating, the value of all ratings will adjust and create the updated point value for the criterion.  To delete a rating, click the rating's Delete icon [2]. Note that you cannot delete the first and last rating for the criterion. To delete the entire criterion, click the criterion Delete icon [3].  To add another criterion, click the Add Criterion link [1]. To create a new criterion, click the New Criterion option [2]. To duplicate an existing criterion, click the name of the criterion you want to duplicate [3]. To find an outcome to align with the rubric, click the Find Outcome link [4].

How do I use grading schemes in a course?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-grading-schemes-in-a-course/ta-p/870,"A grading scheme is a set of criteria that measures varying levels of achievement in a course. Course-level grading schemes are grading schemes that can be defined at both the course level and the assignment level. Without a grading scheme, scores are not measured against any specific standard.  You can enable a grading scheme created by your institution, or you can add a new grading scheme specific to your course.  View a video about Grading Schemes. Grading schemes are built based on points and percentage ranges, and each percentage range is assigned a name value. You can create any type of grading scheme by editing the name and percentage range for each item. When enabling a grading scheme for a course, the grading scheme is applied to the students' final grades in addition to the overall percentage.  Notes:   Letter Grades is the most traditional type of grading scheme and is the default format for new grading schemes. Only supported scores are allowed in the Gradebook, so if you build a letter grade scheme with name values for only A, B, and C, you cannot enter a score that converts to an A- or B+. Performance grading schemes are based on a standard of individual performance. Only supported scores are allowed in the Gradebook, so if you build a performance scheme with the name values of only Excellent and Poor, you cannot enter a score of Good. Points grading schemes are based on a set of points in a range. When the course grading scheme is point-based, Assignment Group totals and Final Score display a tooltip of raw earned points and total points. In the gradebook cell, points display scaled points as fractions. Note: When the Final Grade Override feature option is enabled for an institution and a course is using a point-based grading scheme, instructors can override the grade with a letter grade only. When enabling a grading scheme for a course, the grading scheme is applied to the students' final grades in addition to the overall percentage. Learn how to enable a course grading scheme. Students can view the results of the grading scheme on their Grades page. Grading schemes can be applied specifically to individual assignments. Each assignment includes a field that allows you to choose how the grade is displayed in the Gradebook and in the student Grades page. Learn how to enable an assignment grading scheme. For Letter Grade Schemes, you can input scores in the Gradebook depending on the assignment display type: For Performance schemes, you can input scores in the Gradebook by points, percentage, or performance value. For instance, if an assignment is worth 10 points and the student earns 9, you can input 9 or 90% (which displays the performance defined in the percentage range). You can also input a performance value directly. Note: Grading schemes do not apply to Assignment Group columns in the Gradebook.  In the Grades page, students can see their grades displayed with both the points earned and the grading scheme equivalent."

How do I use SpeedGrader?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-SpeedGrader/ta-p/757,"SpeedGrader makes it easy to evaluate individual student assignments and group assignments quickly.  SpeedGrader displays assignment submissions for active students in your course. However, SpeedGrader displays assignment submissions according to the current Gradebook settings for inactive enrollments and concluded enrollments. For instance, if the Gradebook settings show inactive enrollments, inactive student submissions also appear in SpeedGrader.  You can access SpeedGrader through: Assignments, Quizzes, Graded Discussions, and the Gradebook.  SpeedGrader Performance In SpeedGrader, all values for an assignment are loaded and saved in the browser, including student submission data, any grades (including original grades for resubmitted assignments), rubrics, and comments. This behavior reduces load time while using SpeedGrader, allowing instructors to grade all submissions quickly without continually refreshing the browser. Advancing from one submission to the next does not dynamically load any updated content. In large courses, SpeedGrader loading times are affected by a threshold of data points that can be loaded within a 60-second window. This threshold is based on a single submission per student. Multiple submissions by the same student increases the submission threshold. Assignments with more than 1500 submissions may result in delayed SpeedGrader loading times, and assignments with more than 2500 submissions may fail to load at all. To improve SpeedGrader performance, large courses should be separated into sections, which allows SpeedGrader to display submissions for a specific section and decrease the overall loading time for an assignment's data. SpeedGrader Users SpeedGrader is generally designed for one instructor role to grade submissions at a time. Because of how SpeedGrader data is loaded and stored in the browser, multiple users should not grade assignments at the same time since each grader cannot view the most recent information for a submission. Updated grades also affect the Gradebook. If your course includes multiple graders, graders added to a course can be limited to only interact with users in a section and only grade submissions in the section where they were enrolled. This enrollment option prevents assignment grading overlap so multiple instructor roles cannot grade the same assignment. Moderated Grading If you are grading a moderated assignment and the maximum number of graders has been reached, SpeedGrader will be displayed in a read-only mode to hide all student names and submission details. Learn more about SpeedGrader. Note: Instructors cannot delete assignment submissions. If you need to delete an inappropriate assignment submission, contact your administrator. SpeedGrader includes several areas to help you locate and view student submissions, grade submissions, and add comments to submissions. The SpeedGrader menu includes several tools and resources to assist with grading assignments.  The left side of the menu includes general settings and options.  To return to the Gradebook, click the Gradebook icon [1]. To post or hide the assignment, click the Visibility icon [2]. To view SpeedGrader settings, click the Settings icon [3]. SpeedGrader settings include:  Note: When moderated grading is enabled for an assignment, final graders (moderators) will also view a Moderation Page button, which will allow them to view the Grade Summary Page for the moderated assignment. The center of the menu bar includes assignment information and overall grading information. Assignment information includes the name of the assignment [1], assignment due date [2], and the name of the course [3].  To view the assignment details, click the name of the assignment. The assignment details page also lets you download all student submissions for the assignment.   To return to the Course Home Page, click the name of the course. Grading information includes assignment statistics, including the number of assignments that have been graded out of the total number of students in the course [4] and the average score and percentage [5]. You can use this information to keep track of your grading progress. The right side of the menu bar includes the student list for the assignment. SpeedGrader opens the assignment for the first student listed in the student list, arranged alphabetically by last name. If you have activated student view, the Test Student will be shown at the end of the student list. The student list also displays the status of each student's submission. You can also use the student list to find student submissions. Once you have selected a student, the student's submission displays in the preview window. Depending on the assignment and submission type, the SpeedGrader preview window may vary. For example, a website URL submission type will appear in the main body of SpeedGrader with the option to open the URL in a new tab. Some website URL submissions cannot be viewed in Canvas and must be viewed in a new tab. Media submissions may display as an embedded file in SpeedGrader or only display as a downloadable file. To provide comments on document submissions, you can: Note: When the Allow Multiple file AGS submissions count as one submission is enabled, students can select multiple files to be uploaded to a third-party assignment in Canvas. However, some third-party tools may not be built to accommodate this feature. If a Google Drive or Microsoft Office 365 assignment upload is queued for submission, an Uploading image displays in place of the student submission [1]. An Uploading icon also displays next to the assignment link [2].  When a Google Drive or Microsoft Office 365 assignment submission fails to upload, or when viewing an unsupported file type in SpeedGrader, an Upload Failed image displays [1]. Failed submission uploads display an Upload Failed icon next to the assignment link [2].  SpeedGrader displays assignment submissions according to the current Gradebook settings for inactive enrollments and concluded enrollments. If an assignment includes a submission from an inactive or concluded student, a notice appears at the top of the SpeedGrader window.  For group assignments where students are graded as a group, the group displays as long as there is at least one active student in the group. If there are no active students in the group, the group displays if one group member aligns with the enrollment settings in the Gradebook. For group assignments where students are graded individually, individual student submissions display according to the enrollment settings in the Gradebook. Inactive student submissions can still be graded in SpeedGrader, but students do not receive any notifications about their assignment and cannot view course grades. Concluded student submissions are read-only; they cannot be graded or receive comments. Note: If a student does not have a submission for the assignment, the student may have been deactivated or concluded before being able to submit the assignment. If your course uses multiple grading periods, a notice appears at the top of the SpeedGrader window if an assignment is in a closed grading period. Assignments in a closed grading period cannot be edited. The SpeedGrader sidebar provides all the submission details for the student shown in the student list. However, submission details are not shown when an assignment is graded anonymously. View the submission details [1], including as the date and time of the submission; if an assignment was resubmitted, you can view previous versions of the submission.  You can also download the submission file by clicking the link [2]. Complete the assessment of the submission by entering a grade in the Grade field [3] or using a rubric, if available, by clicking the View Rubric button [4].  You can type feedback comments or insert a comment from the Comment Library using the Assignment Comments section [5]. Assignment comments also display as a new thread in Conversations.  In the SpeedGrader sidebar, you may see the Reassign Assignment button [1]. To reassign the assignment to the student, add at least one comment to the student's submissions [2]. Students will see a to do item in their list view dashboard to resubmit the assignment. In the SpeedGrader sidebar, you can view the student's assignment submission status [1]. To edit the submission status, click the Edit button [2]. Available statuses include Late, Missing, Excused, and None. Once you grade the submission, the student's assignment indicator changes to a check mark, indicating the submission has been graded. You can view the next student's submission by clicking the arrow button next to the student list. When evaluating group assignments, the student list displays the name of each group, unless the group assignment is graded individually. Evaluating group assignments is the same process as individual students. You can mark up documents directly or download them for feedback, enter grades and view the rubric, and post and view comments. Learn more about grading group assignments.  If an assignment was set to be anonymous, the student list displays all student names as anonymous. The student list order does not match the order in the Gradebook and is randomized for each assignment. If an assignment is not anonymous, you can enable anonymous grading in SpeedGrader to hide student names at any time."

How do I grade group assignments in SpeedGrader?,https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-grade-group-assignments-in-SpeedGrader/ta-p/698,"Before you can evaluate group work, you will need to create a group assignment. Students can submit Google documents, pages, and other group work as an assignment. Note: Students should be assigned to groups before group assignments are published. Grades and submissions may be affected for students who were not in a group at the time of assignment submission but who were later added to a group or students who were removed from a group. Open SpeedGrader from the group assignment. When evaluating group assignments, the SpeedGrader drop-down menu displays the name of each group. Select the name of the group whose submission you want to view. To submit a grade for all members of the group, enter the grade in the Grade field [1].  If a Rubric is attached to the assignment, you can view the rubric by clicking the View Rubric button [2].
