0,"Can I use Turnitin without joining an account? In order to use our service you must join an account using an account ID and join password.  You can get this information from your school's account administrator. Individual accounts are available if your school does not currently use Turnitin

2,"How do I get my students started?  Some of them do not have e-mail addresses or access to e-mail at school. There are two ways for students to establish Turnitin accounts: students can register themselves and enroll in the class or instructors can enroll them in the class directly.  
	If you choose to have your students register independently they will have to create a user profile using the link provided on our homepage.  You will need to provide them with the class ID and the enrollment password so that they can join your class.  If your students are not able to use valid e-mail addresses for registration purposes, please have them create a user profile using a fake e-mail address.  To avoid accidentally using a real e-mail address belonging to someone else, make sure you choose a domain that you know does not exist.  Do not use real email domains such as yahoo or hotmail.  For example, name@your-school.Turnitincom is good because there is no such domain your-school.Turnitincom.  Make sure students remember the email address they used to create an account with so they can sign on in the future.
Please note that students using fake email addresses cannot be sent any information through email, including digital receipts and emailed links to reset their passwords.  Students can submit papers; they will also have the opportunity to print their digital receipts after they submit their paper.
There are also training videos and Quickstart guides at http://www.turnitin.com/static/training_support/.

3,"How do I enroll students myself? If you prefer, you have the option to register students from your instructor account.  With this method, you create user profiles for your students and also enroll them in your class.  To add students to your class, log in to your account and click on the appropriate class.  Click on the ""students"" tab in the gray navigation bar near the top-left of the screen.  Click on the ""add student"" link and fill out the appropriate fields.  Please note that you will need valid e-mail addresses for each student in order to complete this process.  If your students are going to be using user names that are not valid e-mail addresses, they will need to set up their own user profiles.
	Once you have added a student to your list, our system will send the student an e-mail with a temporary password.  All students that you add will be able to log in to an established account and will not need any further assistance from you.  Please note that emails may be filtered as spam, so have your students check their spam/bulk mail folders as well.
It is important to remember that if a student has used Turnitin in the past, our system will not generate a temporary password for him or her.  Rather, the student should proceed to login with his or her existing login.  Forgotten passwords may be reset using the ""password help"" link on our homepage.
